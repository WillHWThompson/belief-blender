title] Would it be a net benefit if for most markets, authors were not allowed to trade on their own market? [Resolves to my opinion]\n[Market description] Upsides of disallowing author trading include\n\nSomewhat reduces potential bias for ambiguous resolutions, and significantly reduces the potential for perceived bias, which is important.\n\nMakes it harder for the author to profit by a deliberate misresolution\n\nDownsides of it include\n\nThe author presumably is interested in and knowledgeable about the question, and disallowing them from trading may make the predictions less likely and discourage making some markets.\n\nThe pros and cons can vary greatly depending on the type of market. For personal markets, depending on the goal of the market it may make sense for the author to trade or not, and it's usually a good idea for the author to state their trading policy up-front. But this question is more about non-personal markets.\n\nWhat I'm thinking of here would be something like if markets default to not allowing author trading but it can be optionally turned on. But the specifics could be anything that seems like a good idea - suggestions welcome.\n\nHere are a few previous discussions:\n\nhttps:\/\/manifold.markets\/1\/repost-under-what-conditions-is-it\n\nhttps:\/\/manifold.markets\/Yev\/what-of-manifold-users-think-its-so\n\nhttps:\/\/manifold.markets\/LarsDoucet\/is-it-acceptable-for-a-market-maker\n\nNote: I would rather move away from the model of author having full control over resolutions, towards one where authors resolve most questions but in cases of dispute the final authority rests with a resolution council of some sort. @\/jack\/will-it-be-possible-to-dispute-and . But if we're still stuck with authors deciding all resolutions, it is possible it may be overall good to not allow authors to trade.\n\nResolution\n\nThis question resolves to my subjective belief (credence) that if most markets disallowed author trading, that would be a net benefit for Manifold.\n\nI'll form my belief based on the discussion in the comments, so please let me know why you think it would be good or bad. If you have an opinion you'd like to register, note that I take persuasive comments as much stronger evidence than just betting up\/down. Betting up\/down is essentially a bet about what you think I'll be convinced by and will only minimally influence my resolution.\n\nI will not trade on this market.\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 02-04-2023\n[Closing data] 02-11-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: My current credence here is 60%. Again, I want to reiterate that I don't think this is the best solution - I think it would work better if Manifold moved away from authors having total control over resolutions, as has been discussed in the comments. But thinking about just this change compared to the current state of Manifold, I think it is a bit more likely to be an improvement on net. See my previous comment for the reasoning:  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/jack\/would-it-be-a-net-benefit-if-for-mo#n12CgKQ48UafkExG9Qjy\n---\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  What Gabrielle said is indeed one of the possibilities I was suggesting. The idea is that each market clearly indicates whether author trading is allowed or not, and if most markets do not allow author trading then traders will tend to have a higher degree of trust in those, and can avoid markets that they trust less. I think this is indeed a proposal that fits with the title. It is about what people are allowed to do - even if authors can choose which ruleset to opt in to, once set the rules are binding and communicated clearly, and that's important. And the hypothetical system under consideration would be assumed to apply to most markets for this question.\n---\n[Date]: 02-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   I generally agree that this is important which is why I am very happy to see the change to allow fixing wrong resolutions. Now that is out of the way, I think the remaining issues are much less bad. Subjective markets are already prone to resolution disputes anyway. I don't think so, I would think that's a pretty typical rate of people not sticking around for any new site. For one point of comparison, I just googled for twitter user retention rate stats and apparently \"over 60 percent of new Twitter users fail to return the following month\". I suspect interactions with sketchy markets are responsible for a small fraction of users leaving. Yes, I brought up this point too on one of the other markets. I think removing the author trading helps significantly but ambiguity is still just inherently a problem, and that needs to be addressed directly with one of the many other approaches that have been suggested (delegating resolution to experienced and reliable resolvers, helping users draft good questions, etc)\n---\n[Date]: 02-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Definitely, I also mentioned this in the market: For the purposes of this question, I am assessing the change to author trading assuming Manifold doesn't make other relevant feature changes.\n---\n[Date]: 02-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Ok, here's an update with my current thinking. I still think it has a lot of very important upsides for increasing trust in resolution accuracy.  And I still think it has a very important downside of discouraging some authors from creating markets. I think many authors will still make markets, but it will decrease authorship significantly. A recent development that is quite relevant is that Manifold has finally implemented the ability to undo wrong resolutions!  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/jack\/will-it-be-possible-to-undochange-t#ADaZGoVhPXHhH3CQg98s . This means that at least for objective questions we no longer have to worry much about misresolutions and blatant fraud. Allowing the author to trade on a very objective question (e.g. Will Biden win reelection for President?) seems to be very low downside compared to the upside. For subjective questions, I think removing author trading to reduce author bias and increase market trust in the author's decision is still very important, and I think having an option that authors are encouraged to use for subjective questions would be helpful. Not clear whether most markets are subjective or objective though or which way the default should go though. Glancing through the markets, it seems close-ish to a 50\/50 split between objective vs subjective questions.\n---\n[Date]: 02-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  While that's true, authors will be forced to make a hard decision between allowing author trading and making their market much less popular, or not allowing it and not being able to participate in a question that interested them. So I think having it be an option doesn't actually help much with the problem of author discouragement (although it's hard to know without trying it) - the option is more relevant to allow stuff like personal questions, commitment markets, etc.\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Also I don't think alts should be that big of a concern - I think the fraction of users that have alts is very small (I could be wrong, I don't have any actual data).\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  That is a valid sub-question one could ask, but I think the overall impacts are very hard to measure. They are things like \"increased trust in the markets\" and \"decreased drama\" and \"fewer markets created than counterfactually would have been created\"\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Interesting idea! But that could require or produce mana, so there are some tricky potential difficulties. And it could also be abused.

[Poll, resolves to avg %]\n[Market description] Update: new 1 year poll is live! This poll https:\/\/forms.gle\/A8iPjmNX4ZQz8zht5 asks participants: \"What do you believe was the probability that SBF committed willful fraud in the FTX collapse?\n\nResolution\n\nIn 1 year (November 2023), I will create another instance of the same poll. Resolves to the average (mean) poll response at that time.\n\nMotivation\n\nIn the immediate days after the FTX collapse, a lot of people have quickly concluded that it was willful fraud (e.g. that FTX intentionally loaned out customer deposits which they had committed not to). With the limited information available early on, I believe there is substantial but far from conclusive evidence in favor of this, and that the evidence and information is rapidly changing, and that many people are jumping to conclusions too quickly. You can find a copy of a post I made on this topic at https:\/\/manifold.markets\/post\/in-defense-of-sbf#jIGvMdkFDKDltmegirwJ tl;dr: FTX's failure to hold customer deposits as fully backed deposits seems like it could very plausibly be a combination of bad judgement, terrible accounting practices, and mistakes rather than fraud. I'm not claiming it's likely, just claiming that it's not beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis market is an attempt to quantify the degree of certainty the community has on this question. Many people have been acting as if it is basically 100%, while a seemingly smaller minority believes it is substantially less. This is a type of prediction quesiton, and of course we can resolve different predictions by making a market on it.\n\nNotes\n\nPoll responses must be honest. Do not attempt to manipulate the poll - if I suspect manipulation then I reserve the right to restrict the poll to reputable Manifold users or resolve N\/A.\n\nI am aware that this poll would likely be highly subject to selection bias. I am considering some ideas to mitigate this in another variant of this question; let me know if you have suggestions.\n\nPoll means a literal poll where you answer with a probability, it does not mean a market.\n\nI chose 1 year somewhat arbitrarily. I could also create a version of this that settles when I or the community judge that no more significant evidence is likely to arise.\n\nRelated\n\n[markets]\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 11-15-2022\n[Closing data] 11-15-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Sorry, been traveling - done!\n---\n[Date]: 12-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: The responses to the poll averaged 92% (median 95%).

On short timescales, the current price of a stock or cryptocurrency is the best estimate of what its price will be later that day, and at best the only thing a manifold market adds is some information about expected volatility. Usually the people who win mana in these markets are just whoever is keeping up to date and making bets in line with how the financial market is moving moment-to-moment, without there being any real element of prediction.\n\nIf manifold starts tagging any such markets as \"non-predictive\", such that they aren't eligible for trader bonuses, or does anything else to officially or de facto demote their status compared to other markets, this will resolve YES. The bar for this is low - anything that acts as even the smallest disincentive for even only the most egregiously non-predictive markets will count, as long as it's being done with intent by Manifold, and as long as the markets affected are being singled out specifically for some reason related to them being proxies for financial markets, and not some unrelated reason.\n[Market creator] Chris Billington\n[Creation date] 07-11-2023\n[Closing data] 12-20-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-20-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I think they just don't want to subsidise them, primarily. You might have some luck arguing they should be ranked, though. Obviously without subsidies creators will make fewer of them, but I don't think having fewer of them is the goal, rather not having to pay for them is the goal. I don't like these markets, but that's just my opinion, and as with most user-generated content I don't think Manifold is passing judgement about their existence, they just don't want to pay. I mean, I guess that is passing judgement of sorts - they don't think these markets are predictive enough to be worthy of the subsidies they gladly pay for other markets, because they do want more of other types of markets. So I guess if they want more of other markets then logically, by comparison, they want fewer of these. But I think people should feel entirely free to keep making or participating in such markets, it's just that there'll obviously be less incentive to.\n---\n[Date]: 12-20-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I wonder if it's worth it. The issue is that it's costing them US$27k per year in mana subsidies. Do these markets pull people in and cause them to trade on other markets too, enough for that to be worth it?

Their most popular traders seem to trade on almost nothing else, but I'm not sure about the distribution.\n---\n[Date]: 12-20-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  They're unranked and unsubsidised from now.

Perhaps it is still small enough that these markets make sense from an engagement perspective, perhaps not. But I agree there's a balance there. I'm not sure people enjoy them. I participate in these markets, but kind of begrudgingly - my participation at least isn't evidence I like them. I'm incentivised to participate by the short timeframe, but that's different to liking them. I'm certainly in favour of incentives to encourage \"good\" behaviours too (manifold has plenty of these), but it's not one or the other.

Like, the market creators are just doing it for the trader bonuses and sometimes to be able to take remaining liquidity right before resolving, right? I do these things, but also don't endorse that they're possible\/incentivised, it's not ideally what a prediction market is about. The gripe is about anything where profits are disconnected from prediction. I can see that longer-term stuff about financial markets can be predictive and useful, since current financial market prices are not equivalent to an efficient market's expectation of future prices, but the single-day ones at least are pretty pointless IMHO.\n","[Market title] Will Manifold give us significantly more control over market types, labels, and graph colors by the end of 2023?\n[Market description] There are several ways in which our market choices are very restrictive.\n\nNumeric markets are just binary markets with a mapping from [min, max] into [0%, 100%]. For normal numeric markets the mapping is (X - min) \/ (max - min). For log scale numeric markets, the mapping is scaled logarithmically to be more granular near 0% and 100%. There's no reason these need be the only two options; Manifold could let the market creator specify any mapping function rather than only letting us pick between two specific options. (I think this would primarily be useful for numeric markets on outcomes that have a weird distribution where you want more granularity somewhere that isn't either extreme of the scale.)\n\nFor some reason, numeric markets don't work properly with small ranges. Trying to create a market with a min of 1 and a max of 2 for fine-grained betting results in very low liquidity. I'm not sure why this is, since such a market should be completly isomorphic to a market with a larger range, just scaled down.\n\nGiven the equivalence between binary and numeric markets, Manifold could let us pick whether there's a percentage sign displayed or not. This could be used for markets on events that are known to have a near-0 or near-1 probability; you could create a 0%-100% market on a log scale. Allowing us to display other units, such as currency symbols would be nice. So would a \"date\" unit, where the underlying market is just a numeric market on unix time or whatever, but it displays as a human readible date.\n\nMany binary markets have two roughly equivalent primary outcomes. For example, whether a democrat or a republican president wins the election. Right now, we have to arbitrarily pick one option to highlight in the market, such as \"Will a democrat win the election?\". This is inelegant and skews the market, since it could bias how traders think about the result, and an unexpected result (like an independent candidate winning) will favor one side or the other. This can be solved by using a multiple-choice market instead and creating only two choices. However, multiple-choice markets have a much worse market-making algorithm (you're not guaranteed your payouts when you place a bet) and worse UI (you can't see shares held, can't place limit orders, can't sell any number of shares, etc). This could be fixed by improving multiple-choice markets and\/or giving us the option to label binary markets outcomes with labels other than \"YES\" and \"NO\".\n\nOften there are colors associated with certain market outcomes, such as blue for democrats and red for republicans. But market graphs don't let us pick their colors; on binary markets we're stuck with green and white, and on multiple-choice markets we're stuck with a predetermined selection. Letting the market creators choose what colors represent which options would be a nice aesthetic improvement, and also make it easier for people to hold in their mind what option means what.\n\nIn short, there's a lot of overlap between different market types and use-cases, and a lot of things that it seems like we should able to do that we can't. This market resovles YES if we get a significant number of these options available to us.\n\nFor example, if two-option multiple-choice markets are given the same market mechanism and usability features as binary markets, and we're able to change the graph colors, and low-range numeric markets start working, that would be sufficient to resolve this to YES, even if we don't get the ability to use custom mapping functions. (Unless we lose other options that cancel out those improvements.)\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 12-19-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Nah, those are both tangential, not the core market structure.\n---\n[Date]: 10-18-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The unification of free response and multiple choice markets into a single market type with more granular control over percentages and who can add answers is a big step in this direction, but it's not enough for a YES resolution.

Got a few hundred followers on Twitter and Twitch from it. Started tryharding much more and used prize money to buy a pc and started streaming more. Went to first year uni where instead of studying biochem I just streamed and travelled to tournaments. 30-50 avg conc viewers. After 1st year took a gap year (bc i was depressed, not bc i wanted to pursue streaming as a career). Hearthdtone battlegrounds came out and i became the rank 1 player in the world for ~4 months. Stream grew to 1k+ conc and started getting sponsors. Streamed Hearthstone as my \"fulltime job\"  on and off while struggling with mental health from 2019 - 2021. Made just enough to have my own 1 bed apartment but wasnt that much and started to bleed money when I would stop for random months. Semi quit for 3 months. Then Storybool Brawl came out. Streamed that for around 9 months. Was much more consistent and mental health was upward trajectory. Feb 2022 I meet austin for the first time when he does a 1 hour paid coaching session. May 2022 Austin reached out asking if I wanted to do a work trial as community manager or if I wanted a sponsorship to promote Manifold to my Twitch stream.

It is sufficient to successfully integrate existing work that is not yet part of the model. Of course, to be 'recursive' this must be shown to repeat, and there must be evidence that the later generations are capable of advancements that the initial generation was not capable of.\n\nSince this market is getting more interest, I thought I'd put some clarification here. I'm up for having a 3rd party arbiter of this question, details can be arranged closer to the close date. \n\nIf GPT-5 comes out before the stated close of the market, then the market will close as soon as the question can be evaluated. Subtle self-improvements which quickly plateau out, such as has been seen so far with GPT-4 using Reflexion, will not count. The process doesn't need to be entirely 'within' the model, as direct modifications of the model's weights. It could include external code wrappers and memory systems interfacing through an API. The system does need to show multiple steps of clear improvement, where the later steps are demonstrably better at making further improvements than the earlier steps. \n\nAs clarified in the comments, if the recursive self-improvement can't be clearly demonstrated using less than 3% of the FLOPs used in training GPT-5, then it doesn't count.\n[Market creator] Nathan\n[Creation date] 03-31-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2026\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-25-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Some interesting speculation about what might be on the horizon....  https:\/\/youtu.be\/ARf0WyFau0A?si=X3DEqNkqEsp4W1OT\n---\n[Date]: 05-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Relevant:  https:\/\/backtracks.fm\/80000hours\/pr\/2993337c-eb81-11ed-9b30-0e4b8551d893\/150--tom-davidson-mp3.mp3?s=1&sd=1&u=1683319721\n---\n[Date]: 05-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \"CEO Sam Altman has privately suggested OpenAI may try to raise as much as $100 billion in the coming years to achieve its aim of developing artificial general intelligence that is advanced enough to improve its own capabilities, his associates said.\" -  https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt\n---\n[Date]: 05-03-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  Not until we are able to significantly alter our brains with genetic engineering and brain-computer interfaces.

This market will resolve subjectively, taking into account things like response time and whatever other issues I discover when testing it myself. I don't expect those to be the issue, but in principle if each response takes more than maybe 10 or 20 seconds to generate, I don't care what the benchmark says, the model won't contribute to YES. Same for any other severe usability issues (whatever they may be). Also note that AFAICT guanaco is not open source (commercial use forbidden due to LLaMA geneology).

For example: LLaMa. In the absence of model weights, it's not a chatbot. It's not even a language model. It's code for  training  one of the above, but if that code was applied to a different data set, it would yield a different thing. The reason we call these things \"chatbots\" and so on is because of how they're trained. (Related: scaling discussions necessarily include estimates of how much training data is available.) For all we know, with the right training data and enough compute, Karpathy's MinGPT might achieve ChatGPT-comparable performance. (In fact this is overwhelmingly likely to be true, right? \"Enough compute\" and \"the right data\" are doing heavy lifting here.) But MinGPT was available long before the creation of this market, and of course nobody thought that should yield a YES resolution. The fact that \"yes, this code can in principle be used to construct a chatbot, and this code is open source\" is not sufficient.\n---\n[Date]: 03-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  If companies are using a technically \"non-commercial license\" chatbot for business purposes, doing so in a publicly visible manner, and doing so without getting sued, then that's good evidence that it's  de facto  legal.\n---\n[Date]: 03-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: \"Open source\" implies open source.\n---\n[Date]: 03-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I was not expecting the most difficult part of resolution to be the phrase \"open source\". Yikes! Kinda embarrassed that I missed that one, actually... I think it's unambiguous that LLaMa does not count---leaks aren't the same as open-source. That also excludes Alpaca, at least for now. (Of course, if LLaMa is to be \"officially released\" later, then that could make it count.) At the same time, I'm leaning away from actually invoking OSI's full definition ( https:\/\/opensource.org\/osd\/ ). That's very strict, and would exclude any chatbot developed with a term in the license that says \"you may not use this to destroy the world\". I don't think that's what anybody has in mind when they read this question. I think the requirements for this to resolve YES are: I'm  not  going to require that it be collaboratively developed, or anything like that. That's in some people's definition of open source, but not mine.

ChatGPT is indeed a conversational variant of GPT3.5.

I think I'm requiring a conversational model, so I do mean ChatGPT rather than GPT3.5. I'm not at all confident that I can accurately compare official error rates between ChatGPT and another bot, which may choose to use different metrics. I can't see how to try DaVinci for myself; is there a place where I can? How do you feel about a cutoff of \"conversational, and better than anything appearing prior to ChatGPT\". Is that both clear enough and a reasonable interpretation of \"comparable to ChatGPT\"?\n","[Market title] By the end of 2026, will we have transparency into any useful internal pattern within a Large Language Model whose semantics would have been unfamiliar to AI and cognitive science in 2006?\n[Market description] In \"Moving the Eiffel Tower to ROME\", a paper claimed to have identified where the fact \"The Eiffel Tower is in France\" had been stored within GPT-J-6B, in the sense that you could poke the GPT there and make it believe the Eiffel Tower was in Rome.\n\n\"The Eiffel Tower is in France\" seems (in my personal judgment) like the sort of fact that early AI pioneers could and did represent within GOFAI systems. GPT-J probably does more with that fact - it can for example answer how to get to the Eiffel Tower from Berlin, believing that the Eiffel Tower is in Rome.  But the paper didn't offer neural transparency into how GPT-J gives directions, we don't know the stored patterns for answering that part - just a neural representation of the brute idea that GOFAI pioneers might've represented with in(Eiffel-Tower, Rome).\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis market reflects the probability that, in the personal judgment of Eliezer Yudkowsky, anyone will have uncovered any sort of data, pattern, cognitive representation, within a text transformer \/ large language model (LLM), whose semantic pattern and nature wasn't familiar to AI and cognitive science in 2006 (to pick an arbitrary threshold for \"before the rise of deep learning\").\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso in 2006, somebody might've represented \"the Eiffel Tower is in France\" by assigning spatial coordinates to the Eiffel Tower and a regional boundary to France.  Idioms like that appear in eg video games long predating 2006.  Nobody has yet identified emergent environmental-spatial-coordinate representations inside a text transformer model, so far as I know; but even if someone did so before the end of 2026 - as mighty a triumph as that would be - it would not (in the personal judgment of Eliezer Yudkowsky) be an instance of somebody finding a cognitive pattern represented inside a text transformer, which pattern was unknown to cognitive science in 2006.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2006 similarly knew about linear regression, k-nearest-neighbor, principle components analysis, etcetera, even though these patterns were considered \"statistical learning\" rather than \"Good-Old-Fashioned AI\".  Identifying an emergent kNN algorithm inside an LLM would again not constitute \"understanding via transparency, within an LLM, some pattern and representation of cognition not known in 2006 or earlier\".  Likewise for TD-learning and other biologically inspired algorithms, including those considered the domain of neuroscience (from 2006 or earlier).\n\n\u00a0\n\nGOFAI and kNN and similar technologies did not suffice to, say, invent new funny jokes, or carry on a realistic conversation, or do any sort of intellectual labor.  The intent of this proposition, if relevant, is to assert that by end of 2026 we will not be able to grasp any inkling of the cognition inside of LLMs by which they do much more than AIs could do in 2006; we will not have decoded any cognitive representations inside of LLMs supporting any cognitive capabilities original to the era of deep learning.  We will only be able to hunt down internal cognition of the sort that lets LLMs do more trivial and old-AI-ish cognitive steps, like localizing the Eiffel Tower to France (or Rome); on their way to completing larger and more impressive tasks, incorporating other cognitive steps; whose representations inside the LLM, even if we have some idea of which weights are involved, have not yet been decoded in a way semantically meaningful to a human.\n[Market creator] Eliezer Yudkowsky\n[Creation date] 09-30-2022\n[Closing data] 02-01-2027\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 06-15-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:   Copycat and Metacat are some of the leading previous explicit, semantically understood algorithms for analogies and analogies between analogies.\n---\n[Date]: 06-15-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I agree with  @NLeseul.\n---\n[Date]: 06-13-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:   This market is not about identifying semantics inside an LLM.

A Bayesian view of that is just a kind of understanding.  I'm not going to say \"it's just Bayes\" because every cognitive process that does useful work contains some Bayesian grain of validity that explains why it works.  But that's a separate topic.

Vance Jr., began its own investigation after the presidential pardon, which covered only federal charges.\n\nFederal prosecutors had accused Mr. Bannon and three other men in 2020 of cheating donors to We Build the Wall, which aimed to construct at least 100 miles of barrier on private land.\n\nThe authorities said Mr. Bannon hatched a plot to defraud donors with three other men: Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran and triple amputee from Miramar Beach, Fla.; Andrew Badolato, a venture capitalist from Sarasota, Fla.; and Timothy Shea, an entrepreneur from Castle Rock, Colo.\n\nThey were accused of taking money for personal expenses like hotel and credit card bills and to buy jewelry, a golf cart and a luxury S.U.V. The fund-raising effort collected more than $25 million, and prosecutors said Mr. Bannon used nearly $1 million of it for personal expenses.\n\nMr. Kolfage and Mr. Badolato pleaded guilty in April to wire fraud conspiracy in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Kolfage also pleaded guilty to tax-related charges.\n\nRelated\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/LivInTheLookingGlass\/how-many-days-will-bannon-be-senten)\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 01-03-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Biden's classified documents be largely forgotten in 3 months? (on April 14)\n[Market description] Some of Joe Biden's lawyers discovered in his Delaware home some classified documents he kept from Obama's presidency. Biden's team returned the documents and claims it was an accident. However, Kevin McCarthy called for the launch of an investigation. Here's the Wikipedia article: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\n\nResolves YES if this whole situation is largely forgotten by the media and the popular zeitgeist 3 months from today (on April 14th) and NO otherwise. N\/A if it's especially ambiguous. This is a subjective market, but I'll do my best to resolve fairly. \n\nConservative media outlets will be weighted modestly: if liberal\/mainstream media stops covering it but it's a very frequent talking point on Fox News, for example, this will probably resolve NO, but YES if it's only an occasional Fox talking point. Other factors I may consider include: level of awareness among people I know (including those who don't follow politics), level of conversation on Twitter, and number of Manifold markets made on the subject.\n\nI will not bet on this market unless I feel it is very mispriced.\n\nGeneral policy for my markets: In the rare event of a conflict between my resolution criteria and the agreed-upon common-sense spirit of the market, I may resolve it according to the market's spirit or N\/A, probably after discussion.\n\nFeb 3, 7:00am: Will Biden's classified documents be largely forgotten in 3 months? \u2192 Will Biden's classified documents be largely forgotten in 3 months?

Two-stories bonus: 0\/1 Google search: 1\/1 ( https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/04\/11\/us\/politics\/congress-trump-biden-classified-documents.html ) Popular zeitgeist: 0.5\/6 People I know: 0\/2 (I polled people I knew in three places (fine, some of them were strangers on a crossword Discord server) about the classified documents. With the options being \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cMaybe briefly\u201d, and \u201cNo\u201d, the results were 0-1-4, 0-5-12, and 1-11-19. These clearly meet my cutoffs (>50% in the last category and >75% in the last two), so no points. I realize now that I phrased the points for this in the opposite way that I meant to, since the points are meant to represent remembering, not forgetting. Oops. So technically I\u2019m inverting the points. Anyway, zero.) Google Trends: 0.5\/2 (It\u2019s saying 2% for the last week, and (2-1)\/2 = 0.5.) Manifold: 0\/2 (literally couldn\u2019t find any from the last two weeks) Poll: ~2.8\/12 Result was 7-2 YES-NO unweighted. Of the voters, I only identified jack as also being a shareholder, but some people voted whose Manifold usernames I don\u2019t know. (I shouldn\u2019t have used this exact criterion.) I\u2019m just gonna call it 13-4, since (spoiler) the exact result doesn\u2019t matter too much. That\u2019s (4\/17)*12, or about 2.8. Even if all the YES voters were shareholders, it\u2019s only about 4.3 points. ConfluX-factor: 1\/6 There are certainly still some news articles about it here and there, but what impressed me today is how few people have thought about it at all recently. The classified documents aren\u2019t not literally forgotten in the sense that no one remembers them, but, like so many news stories that feel super major at the time they break, they seem to be mostly out of The Discourse, which is what this market was intended to measure. Therefore, with about 5.8 memory points out of a needed 10, it's not super close, and I am relieved from the duty of getting into the weeds: it is clear that the classified documents were \u201clargely forgotten\u201d, and I\u2019m resolving this market YES! Thanks everyone for participating. Next time I'll try to have clearer resolution criteria from the start, I think :)\n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  ( and  there's also the double-counting-if-no-shares thing, forgot about that)\n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  No worries!

Therefore, I've prepared a point system! RESOLUTION POINT SYSTEM (which I will carry out April 14)\u00a0 I will award up to 30 \"memory points\" measuring whether the documents are \"largely forgotten by the media and the popular zeitgeist\". 10 memory points will be required for a NO resolution. Fractional points are possible in some cases. Anything that says \u201ccurrently\u201d etc below is actually as of yesterday. Media (6 points possible) I will survey the following media sources: I will count the number of total articles mentioning the classified documents (I'll adjust upward for prominence if they're top headlines, or downward if they're hiding in small print) on these webpages (without hitting \"show more\" etc) mentioning the classified documents. Each article is worth 1 point, capped at 4. An additional 1 point is available if at least two different \u201cstories\u201d are included.\u00a0 (Currently I see 1 on Fox, which I might adjust downward since it's in the sidebar and just says \"Biden visits University of Pennsylvania campus for the first time since classified documents controversy\", and none on the other sites.) Then, I will google \u201cbiden classified documents\u201d and spend a few minutes trying to find an article from April from NYT, CNN, or Fox. If I find one, 1 point. Popular zeitgeist (6 points possible) I promised \"level of awareness among people I know (including those who don't follow politics), level of conversation on Twitter, and number of Manifold markets made on the subject\". So let's do that! Poll (12 points possible) I will do the simple thing and just post a poll on the Manifold discord with this wording: \"Do you feel that this market (link) on whether Biden's classified documents have been largely forgotten by the media and popular zeitgeist should resolve YES?\", with emoji reactions for YES and NO. Number of points is 12 times the proportion of NO voters. The vote of anyone who's not holding a position on this market counts for double.\u00a0 ConfluX-factor (6 points possible) This  is  a market about my subjective opinion, after all. I'll go by vibes. (Currently I'm feeling like 1-2 points.) I'll tabulate these points, and if there are at least 10 (that's 1\/3 of possible points), I'll resolve this market NO. If there are under 10, I'll resolve YES. I reserve the right to change my mind about this if clear flaws are found in this point system, or override anything that ended up being a clearly flawed metric. Certainly it's very complicated. But I think it should be an objective thing that captures what I see as the spirit of this market!        et al, thoughts?\n---\n[Date]: 04-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  (temporarily halting trading until then)\n---\n[Date]: 04-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I hit send on this early, please ignore it!

I think currently it is in some circles and not in others (it isn't really in mine! but I don't read actual newspapers as much as some people; this affected my discussion with Gabrielle upwards in the comment thread), which makes me wish I was more clear about the weighting of the different factors I mentioned in my description.  Again, I hope to come up with something clearer soon, I'm sorry this became about forecasting how I personally interpret \"largely forgotten\". I probably will consult some people uninvolved with this market on what they feel are reasonable reference points. Maybe I'll do some polling. I wanna resolve in a way that's consistent with the way most people have interpreted the subject of the market, though it seems like there hasn't been a 100% consensus, sadly.\n---\n[Date]: 03-28-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: tfw everyone is trying to read your mind\n---\n[Date]: 03-28-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  That\u2019s approximately what I was thinking, yeah.

I'm quite surprised and legitimately didn't realize it was still getting this much media coverage. I think you've provided clear and compelling evidence that this market should resolve NO if it closed right now, and my fill of your limit order now feels like a pretty bad investment.

There are still articles being published about the classified documents, which have been linked in the comments. On the other hand,  the newest Manifold market with the keyword \"classified documents\"  was created a month ago, and I haven't personally heard people talk about it much recently.  This is not a final decision from me, but I would expect there to be renewed interest or a new twist in the classified documents story for this market to resolve NO.\n---\n[Date]: 02-03-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Oh sorry, I just realized I sold M$38 NO shares at a loss from 48 to 49, which technically contradicts my promise to not bet on this market unless I feel it is very mispriced.

It is so clear Trump only ever appointed this judge to use one day as a tool and other judges are not going to appreciate that, especially ones appointed by him because it undermines their credibility.

But it\u2019s not because he is being persecuted or whatever, it\u2019s because if the media weren\u2019t obsessed with talking about his sketchy behavior we would be well on our way to forgetting about him and his very forgettable presidency.

(2024)\n[Market description] This market predicts whether an AI alignment research paper will be featured on the cover of a prestigious scientific journal, such as Nature, Science, or PNAS, by December 31, 2024.\n\nResolves YES if:\n\nAn AI alignment research paper is featured on the cover of a prestigious scientific journal on or before December 31, 2024.\n\nResolves PROB if:\n\nThere is uncertainty as to whether the best candidate is considered an AI alignment research paper.\n\nResolves NO if:\n\nNo AI alignment research paper is featured on the cover of a prestigious scientific journal by December 31, 2024.\n\nResolves as NA if:\n\nAll of the prestigious scientific journals cease to exist, merge, or undergo significant restructuring, rendering the original intent of the market unclear or irrelevant.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"AI alignment research paper\" refers to a research paper focused on the study of AI safety, alignment, or value alignment, addressing the challenge of ensuring that AI systems understand and respect human values, preferences, and intentions, even as they improve their capabilities. Examples of AI alignment topics include, but are not limited to, corrigibility, reward modeling, interpretability, and robustness.\n\n\"Prestigious scientific journal\" refers to high-impact, peer-reviewed academic journals with a strong reputation in the scientific community. Examples include Nature, Science, and PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). The market creator may add journals to this list; the main requirement is that the journal not be AI-focused, emphasizing that the result is of general scientific interest. If there's a dispute, a poll may be taken to decide whether a new entry is qualified.\n\n\"Featured on the cover\" means that the AI alignment research paper is the primary focus of the journal's cover image or design, or is highlighted on the cover through text or images. The cover feature should emphasize the significance of the AI alignment research paper. It is the responsibility of market participants to bring candidates to the market creator's attention for judgment: if no candidates are raised for attention by traders or by the market creator, then the market resolves NO even if later someone realizes that an example would have qualified - in this case, I will provide 1 week of leeway after announcing my intended resolution, for anyone to provide examples.\n\nIn the event of a PROB resolution, market creator is responsible for determining a confidence and resolving to it. Tools used may include reading the paper and making their own determination, creating a poll, or asking alignment researchers.\n\nMarket creator will not bet more than a token amount(M10) in this market, since the criteria are subjective.\n\nMarket description changes\n\n2023-04-03: Clarified that traders are responsible for bringing candidates to the market's attention.

So that paper would not qualify, since it only gathers statistical evidence. If they use social issues as an example topic, that's okay as long as the article is primarily about progress on solving it. For example, \"We extracted a matching stochastic grammar out of base GPT-4 used for algorithmic recommendations and observed that its triggers to be Republican-biased or say racist things are X,Y,Z.\" would likely constitute an interpretability advance.  An article about algorithmic recommendations would count as long as they make progress on a general alignment problem: It doesn't need to identify as AI research or mention alignment, as long as progress towards an alignment topic was made in the course of researching it. Another example: The \" Stochastic parrots \" paper would not qualify, even though is explicitly about AI safety and cites risks and harms of AI, because it is merely identifying an issue and has no progress on solving it. There's no actual research in that paper. Another example:  Volume 615 Issue 7953, 23 March 2023 ( nature.com )  is dated just a few days ago, involves training one AI to oversee another, and mentions \"safety of an AI driver\". On the surface it might seem to qualify. The main reason it would not qualify, is that it's more about cost efficiency or \"getting it working\" than about constraining the worst possible outcomes. A similar example( [2212.08073] Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback ( arxiv.org ) )  would likely qualify if researchers set out to make a language model that doesn't say racist things, started with a toxic model, and end up with a robust model that mostly solves the problem. A paper can't just be stirring public controversy, and must be of scientific or mathematical value in the study of reliably controlling AI systems. It also must focus on controlling the worst outputs and not just cost efficiency or the average case, so statistical evidence is not likely to be enough. If there's a dispute about my judgment on any paper counting as alignment, I would read counterarguments, and if I still disagree likely hold a poll.\n","[Market title] Will AI be a major topic during the 2024 presidential debates in the United States?\n[Market description] [image]This question resolves to YES if during at least one of the main (non-VP) 2024 general presidential election debates in the United States, the moderator asks at least two separate questions directly related to artificial intelligence, such as the potential for job losses due to AI automation, or existential risk from AI. This question also resolves to YES if AI is otherwise brought up by a candidate in the context of a question unrelated to AI and ALL candidates talk about AI at least once during the same debate, with at least one of the candidates saying \"AI\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"robots\" or a close synonym at least three separate times, at least five seconds apart, during the same debate. Otherwise, this question resolves to NO.\n\nAsking \"at least two separate questions\" means that the moderator must pose two semantically distinct and individual queries, each intended to elicit a unique response, specifically about artificial intelligence. In other words, simply repeating the same question doesn't count as two separate questions, even if the question is asked twice, first to one candidate, and then a second time to the other candidate. Moreover, asking two distinct questions without waiting for the answer to the first one counts as two separate questions for the purpose of this question. For example, a clear positive instance would be asking first, \"How do you plan to manage the existential risks from AI?\" and then later asking, \"What are your proposals to mitigate job loss due to automation from AI?\" These are two separate questions because they cover different facets of artificial intelligence\u2014existential risk and employment. A clear negative example would be if the moderator simply asked, \"How do you plan to manage the existential risks from AI?\" to one candidate, and then later said \"Same question to you\" to the other candidate. Even though the question is asked twice, it's not considered two \"separate\" questions because it's a repetition of the same query.\n\nWhen it comes to questions related to automation and job losses, the key factor that determines whether the question is \"directly related to artificial intelligence\" is whether the moderator mentions AI technologies or AI companies, such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, generative AI, or neural networks; any question will automatically qualify if the moderator says the word \"AI\" or \"artificial intelligence\" in the question. General questions about automation or job losses that don't clearly link back to AI won't be considered \"directly related to artificial intelligence\". For example, the following questions would NOT count as being directly related to artificial intelligence:\n\n\"How will your administration address the growing issue of job losses due to technological advances?\" \u2014 Too broad; doesn't specify AI.\n\n\"What are your plans for helping workers displaced by automation?\" \u2014 Not specific to AI; includes all automation.\n\nIf there are no 2024 general presidential election debates, this question resolves to N\/A.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 01-24-2023\n[Closing data] 11-06-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  There must be two  separate  questions about AI. This condition was just clarified in a lengthy paragraph. I think it makes sense to classify AI as a major topic if two separate questions are asked about it during the same debate.\n---\n[Date]: 11-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Why does it matter whether there's no new source of automation if the old sources continue apace? In this context, the question is whether people are worried about AI or worried about non-AI automation. If non-AI automation continues to worry people separately from AI automation, that seems important. This is why I feel it is valuable to clarify that there must be some signal that the question asked is about AI, in order to trigger a positive resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 10-28-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I disagree that there's no source of automation other than AI. Automation has been going on for centuries now at a surprisingly constant rate in the US, and my guess is that the most automation in the last 3 years has come from sources other than deep learning.  This paper  suggests that deep learning hadn't automated many jobs as of 2019; and although the paper is 4 years old, I'd expect similar results if the paper were replicated today. Automation from LLMs and AI art generators is extremely new right now and has only affected a very tiny portion of the labor force. That could dramatically change by the time of the presidential election next year, but I doubt it.\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I'm not sure how clarifying things is worse than keeping the question vague. Can you expand a little bit on your reasoning? It seems to me that I should aim for maximum clarity as early as possible rather than keep people in the dark about how I will resolve the question. This is different from changing the criteria, however, and it seems you acknowledge that too. Overall I don't understand your argument for why I should keep more subjective criteria in place.\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good point.

This is supposed to be the probability that given that \"we would be to superintelligence as animals \/ 3 years olds are to us\", and also that \"capabilities will be so fast that we will not be able to respond in time by a proper policy\", given those things as already true, \"the first attempt to get rid of humanity is successful\". Well, suppose that I am trying to take candy from a baby. And further suppose that the baby is not able to respond in time. Will my first attempt to take the candy be successful? I don't think this is 99% only because there may be race dynamics with other AIs that are also trying to take over the world, in the scenario where lethal AGI is deployed in parallel. Conditional on humanity deploying a lethal AI and miraculously surviving, the odds that we would be exactly that stupid again seem pretty high to me. Plus the odds of multiple AIs trying to take over the world at once. Plus the odds that the ensuing chaos causes a death spiral. Generally when modeling risk you should be adding up all the known and unknown pathways to risk, not estimating the odds of a single pathway. Your estimate will be too low otherwise. And I say this as a NO better who agrees than 21% by 2030 is too high.\n---\n[Date]: 05-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  agreed, I was not responding to the possible belief inconsistencies.

Whereas the weather is chaotic and easier to change. A double pendulum is very chaotic but modern robots can balance them easily. Humans are too slow, of course. A feature of chaotic systems is that very small changes can cause very large effects. This makes them easier to control than linear systems, where very large effects require very large changes. Truly random systems are harder to predict and to control, but you were talking about chaotic systems, not random ones. We could discuss randomness separately but I doubt you think that true randomness is a factor in your probability.\n---\n[Date]: 05-19-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:   p_s is 20%? I think this is above 99%. I frequently interact with people who are much smarter than me in their area of expertise. They just win. And this is purely within the human realm of intelligence, and purely a 1:1 competition. Chaotic systems are harder to predict but conversely easier to control.

Did his autism simply flare up? Did he ran out of his medication? Maybe seeing his father's belt triggered some bad childhood memories. Or perhaps his favourite cuckold website got shut down. Is there a chance that his coworkers found out about his latex fetish? Could it be that someone saw him peeing in his basement? Was it his mom who saw him peeing in his basement? Did the experience embarrass or arouse him? All quite probable causes for Isaac soy rage posting at me. Regardless, his posts gave inspiration to this market and I think he will appreciate me emulating him a bit by posting this market on his markets as well.\n","[Market title] Will the Nick Fuentes Bridge be reconstructed before the end of 2022?\n[Market description] BRIDGE IS OFFICIALLY REBUILT IF:\nDestiny has 2 or more friendly conversations with him on stream\nor\nINSTANT win if they do another IRL(unrelated to a debate\/podcast) (The \"INSTANT WIN\" Clause was meant to account more for a stream more akin to the chicken and waffles one.

[M$1000 subsidy]\n[Market description] I have a bit of free time these days, and have been neglecting my blog as of late. Luckily, I have some project ideas! But I'm having trouble deciding which one to work on. \n\nIn an ideal world, I'd get all of them done this summer, and each project seems individually pretty doable! But I am no stranger to the planning fallacy, scope creep, and my own perfectionism, and therefore expect each of these to take substantial time and effort. \n\nI'd love suggestions on which of these projects I should pursue most! I'll give a pitch for each option.\n\nIs 69 Unique? The Search for Nice Numbers [video adaptation of the blog post]\n\nI've written two popular blog posts on \"nice numbers\", and @\/Conflux\/will-3blue1brown-publish-a-video-ab may or may not happen. But math videos are maybe more accessible\/potentially-viral than blog posts, and Grant from 3B1B was supportive of the idea of me making my own video about nice numbers and entering it into his third Summer of Math Exposition contest. Could bring the joy of nice numbers to new audiences!\n\nI have the content here, and some visuals\/writing to use as a starting point. I've never made a YouTube video this involved though. SoME3 deadline is Aug 18 so that's a bit of forcing factor. \n\nAin\u2019t a Bad Lie: A Crucimusical Multimedia Experience [video]\n\nThis would be an adaptation of a multi-layered presentation I gave at a \"presentation party\". I don't wanna spoil anything! But I think it's fun...\n\nCould make it a blog post, but am more enthusiastic about recording myself presenting the slideshow (which I could probably do in a sitting), then adding the overture in video editing, which may be more finicky. \n\nOne-Sentence Book Reviews 2022-23 [blog post]\n\nI did this last year, and thought it was reasonably fun and successful! I remember thinking I'd do it again in a year. It's not as flashy as some of the other options, but it might be faster to make. \n\nThe Market Manipulation Podcast (and Tales from Manifold) [blog post]\n\nI've mentioned Manifold on my blog, but have yet to fully introduce it to my audience. This post would link to and describe the first four episodes of the Market Manipulation Podcast, but an ideal version of it would also have some background and fun anecdotes about Manifold - which is potentially the harder part to execute well. \n\nNote that I am expecting y'all to be slightly biased toward this option!\n\nSomething else\n\nMaybe I'll prefer another idea! It counts for this market if it's a nontrivial blog post or internet project. \n\nNote for resolving this market: for the main four options, they won't have to be exactly as described or exactly with the tentative title I wrote - they just have to have the essence of the project, in my judgement. \n\nI will extend this market until I publish my next nontrivial blog post or internet project. But I'd be disappointed with myself if I didn't publish anything within the next few weeks. \n\nGeneral policy for my markets: In the rare event of a conflict between my resolution criteria and the agreed-upon common-sense spirit of the market, I may resolve it according to the market's spirit or N\/A, probably after discussion.\n[Market creator] Conflux\n[Creation date] 07-05-2023\n[Closing data] 08-17-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n---\n[Date]: 08-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: https:\/\/beautifulthorns.wixsite.com\/home\/post\/the-market-manipulation-podcast-five-episodes-five-stories-at-the-conflux-of-serious-and-meme\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: market not updating very much on apparent delays hmm hmm\n---\n[Date]: 07-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I should mention that I won\u2019t do an unpopular option just to spite the market!

(i.e. \"I've looked at all notable evidence presented by both sides and have upwards of 98% confidence that a certain conclusion is correct, and it doesn't seem likely that any further relevant evidence will be forthcoming any time soon.\")\n\nThis will likely not occur until many years after Covid is no longer a subject of active political contention, and motivations for various actors to distort or hide inconvenient evidence have died down.\n\nI will be conferring with the community extensivly before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another. As some additional assurance, see @\/IsaacKing\/will-my-resolution-of-the-covid19-l\n\n(For comparison, the level of evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change would be sufficient, despite the existance of a few doubts here and there.)\n\nIf we never reach a point where I can safely be that confident either way, it'll remain open indefinitely. (And Manifold lends you your mana back after a few months, so this doesn't negativly impact you.)\n\n\"Come from a laboratory\" includes both an accidental lab leak and an intentional release. It also counts if COVID was found in the wild, taken to a lab for study, and then escaped from that lab without any modification. It just needs to have actually been \"in the lab\" in a meaningful way. A lab worker who was out collecting samples and got contaminated in the wild doesn't count, but it does count if they got contaminated later from a sample that was supposed to be safely contained.\n\nIn the event of multiple progenitors, this market resolves YES only if the lab leak was plausibly responsible for the worldwide pandemic. It won't count if the pandemic primarily came from natural sources and then there was also a lab leak that only infected a few people.\n\nI won't bet in this market.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 09-01-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2040\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-19-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]: By the way, I'm noticing that many people's positions in this market are pretty small relative to their apparent confidence.

The physical building, or materials sent out from it. For example if they were sending a sample by truck to another lab, and it escaped from the truck, that counts. If it happened outside the lab, doesn't count. If it happened inside the lab, counts iff the sample had been intentionally collected and was being used for study. The lab leak must be plausibly responsible for the worldwide pandemic. If the local population's infection likely never would have spread further on its own, that's a YES.

If culture war dynamics around China and Covid reverse again in the next few years, I wouldn't be surprised to see such pronouncements being made. I'd like to see at least the beginnings of a scientific consensus that seems unmotivated by politics. (For example, consider the consensus that IQ is mostly genetic, and the fact that Wikipedia is willing to make that claim on their site, despite how unpopular that belief is.) I would be willing to resolve against consensus only in the event that it becomes  extremely  clear that the mainstream is wrong, and I can understand the technical aspects of the situation well enough to see this myself. (For an example of this, consider how cryonics is called a pseudoscience because it hasn't yet been tested. This is a basic misunderstanding of what claims cryonics advocates are making, and another basic misunderstanding of how intelligent agents perform inference about the world and the purpose of performing experiments. It seems to be largely motivated by religious beliefs and culturally-ingrained rationalizations about death, not by the relevant details of the actual claim.) I don't have a good enough understanding of biology at the moment to be comfortable declaring that so many biologists are wrong based only on a statistical argument that has nothing to do with the actual details of the virus in question. If the topic stagnates and it seems likely that no more information will be forthcoming then I might start investigating it more seriously myself, but at the moment it makes a lot more sense for me to let other people do that investigation and argument.

The Chinese government choosing to cooperate fully with a non-politically-driven western investigation and that investigation concluding zoonosis would also be compelling, though I'm sure there would still be concerns they'd destroyed all the evidence or it was created elsewhere.

If there isn't, the market will just stay open indefinitely, allowing people to win or lose money as new evidence comes out and people's subjective probabilities change. I don't plan on resolving this market if there's still a credible doubt either way. (This likely does bias the market slightly in favor of YES, since it's easier to get definitive evidence that it was lab-created than that it wasn't.)\n---\n[Date]: 09-02-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Is there a particular reason you don't trust me to resolve this market correctly?\n---\n[Date]: 09-01-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Wikipedia and much of the world's media would disagree, so I don't think I can safely call that \"definitive\".\n","[Market title] Will I get covid by mid-2023?\n[Market description] Or specifically, will I test positive for covid by the end of June 2023?

It's been two weeks now, so probably too late to check better, apologies. (Pic from cue website.)

I decided it was negative. But hours later it seemed to have developed into an extremely faint line (still ambiguous, but I would have resolved pos if it looked like that earlier). Hours later line doesn't count as pos according to the test rules anyway, but makes me wonder if it was actually the weakest of positives earlier when I was uncertain. I then took a bunch more tests over the following days, which were all clearly neg.  I'm inclined to call this negative, since according to the rules of how to use tests (can you see a line with your eyes within the time window) it was, but tell me if you disagree. I'm invested int this market, so if there is disagreement, I think I should ask a third party to judge.\n---\n[Date]: 03-07-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I'm pretty averse to being unethical, for complicated reasons hopefully to do with ethics.

One goal of leagues is to keep users engaged, which doesn't work so well if you are rewarding past behaviour. It can also make it unfair to go into a new league if someone has tons of markets from previous seasons which are contributing. So we prefer a fresh start. For the record, I don't think incentivising short term markets is necessarily a bad thing. I think some level of forcing people to think of how they can reframe long term questions to resolve more quickly that still helps forecast the end question is a good thing. People don't like predicting on far-off questions and struggle to think in big picture long term probabilities which is often less actionable anyways.\n---\n[Date]: 05-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  they shouldnt, it's on the list of things to do\n---\n[Date]: 05-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  we are a startup that is constantly pumping out tons of new features.

She said her spoken english is much worse than her written english, so sometimes she said a few words in english, and sometimes I said a few words in Ukrainian, but we also used Google Translate. I took the initiative and grabbed her hand. She seemed to like that, because she kept holding her hand out for me to hold throughout the rest of the date. She then she invited me to keep walking with her to the city center, which is another good sign. I asked her if she wanted to kiss, but she said she doesn't kiss that quickly. Which, I suppose, is good. When we said goodbye, we hugged TWICE. Sweet.

So I woke up 42 minutes late and resulted in us missing the train with people from the university club to the convention and she wasn\u2019t angry at all. \n1. She pretty much stayed with me at all times at convention, even when she met her other friends.\n1.1 She gave up the opportunity to spend more time with a friend she hadn\u2019t spoken to in 2 years to hang with me.\n2. When I asked her if she wanted to (a) leave at 18:00 to leave with the rest of the club, or (b) leave later and maybe see some mutual acquaintance she said b would be better.\n3. She instinctively referred to us as \u201cwe\u201d on the group chat without clarifying (I had to).\n4. When we were in the train with this other club member, he offered to switch places with me so I could talk to her.\n5. She decided to order at the \u201cfancy\u201d pizza place I went to even though it was a bit \u201cpricey\u201d and her other friend went to a burrito place which I assume was cheaper.\n6. When the mutual acquaintance (who had a place to stay in the convention city) was there and we were leaving, I suggested he drop us off at the train station, and she said he shouldn\u2019t, ostensibly because he\u2019s tired.\n7. She was upset I didn\u2019t attend a club showing because of some homework.\n8. She specifically texted me when I came late to a club showing.\n9. She accepted my dinner invitation (as friends) at short notice, and then we stayed there for three hours. \n9.1 When I said we should leave because the place is closing, she didn\u2019t believe me initially and wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve wanted to go if it weren\u2019t closing.\n10. We were up till 04:30 (arriving at my place at 22:15) playing Lover\u2019s Spacetime and we only stopped because I said I wanted to.\n\nOn average, we have spent 10 hours a week seeing each other in person, and another 10 hours a week texting.\n\nFeb 22, 12:20am: to be clear, this is about romantic liking. This will resolve when either\n0. I ask her out and then her response is yes or no;\n1. the deadline passes, leading to N\/A; or\n2. she starts dating someone else, in which case it is no.\n\nI\u2019m aware there\u2019s a small possibility she could like me, but still says no. Unless I otherwise am informed, the question will resolve to no if she says no.\n\nFeb 22, 1:41am: Good comment from @Jd about negative signals.\nIn terms of negative signals: we're both nerds, and in particular the evidence shows that she doesn't have many other quality friends (she complains about her \"friends\" not really talking and staring at their phones), so maybe she wants to spend more time with me since I actually talk to her. \n\nAnother negative signal is that she almost never initiates, it is almost always me, although whenever I initiate, if it's online she responds instantly most of the time, and for anything in person she's never said no before, and it's always been me ending the hang out sessions.\n\nWe've known each other for more than a year now, but only now really started to hang out (because covid), and before she didn't seem all too interested back then.\n\n\"Le monde moderne, ce sont des id\u00e9es \u00e0 la mode qui passeront comme toutes les modes\"\n\nFeb 22, 13:12: Another possibly negative signal. The club organised a trip to some attraction, but she didn't manage to make the cut-off for reservations. While there we were texting and we had the following exchange (the final response was delayed by several minutes):\n\"how is it?\n\u2014 Alright, kinda miss you.\n\u2014 there there, i'm sure you'll be fine without me\"\nMy message was sent somewhat tactically to see how she feels about me, and her dismissive response could be seen as a \"friend-zone\". But it's also possible she meant it jokingly, or didn't want to respond too strongly as she doesn't know that I like her. Note that we tend to make a lot of jokes, and tend to tease each other frequently.\n\nFeb 23, 1:09pm: Also I encourage anyone to ask questions to better ascertain my chances.\n\nFeb 23, 8:41pm: @Lorenzo In actuality I did ask her, and I do know the answer. But the thing is when I developed the crush, I had recently read about subjective probability, and decided to ask them to tell me what probability they think based on the information I provide and see how it updates overtime, with the messages you\u2019re reading.\n\nRecently I found out about Manifold and decided to post the messages from out chatlog and conversations here to see what people think. I encourage everyone to play honestly, because then it\u2019s more interesting. I\u2019m making sure I don\u2019t ever say anything I know from after I asked her to make sure it\u2019s fair. I also get 50:50 so it\u2019s fair (but mostly because I didn\u2019t realise what it was asking as it was my first time).\n\nIn terms of why I didn\u2019t ask immediately, well I\u2019m an awkward nerd, I needed to work up the courage, to plan how to, and the best moment was 14 days after I developed feelings for her in the real timeline. I also don\u2019t think you should ask out female friends without knowing there\u2019s at least a small possibility (>= 10 %) they might like you, because otherwise due to the unfortunately gendered nature of dating, it means they have a lot of male friends just falling for them \u201cout of the blue\u201d which is unfortunate.\n\nWhoops, \u201cdecided to ask them\u201d should read \u201c decided to ask my friends\u201d.\n\nFeb 25, 12:17pm: (the story will still be in present tense, since the secret is out, I'll post an update every few days so the market has enough time to react but often enough so it's still interesting) \n\nSo I dragged my friends to the club we go to, to see her. When we were walking to the club, I'd mentioned she'd see my friends, and things were a bit awkward. Honestly, things stayed kinda awkward for most of the night, but got better once it was just us again. I also standing\/being closer to her tonight, at the start of the night she would move away, or it seemed like she placed a coat to prevent it, but as it went on she stopped moving away.\n\nMy friends had said based on the information, before they assigned a probability of 30 % that she liked me, but now they assigned 50 %.\n\nAfter my friends were gone, we were talking about the latest club activity which mentioned mental health, and she began talking about one of her friend's mental health problems for like 20 minutes before apologising for basically doxxing them, and saying \"I don't know why I told you all that\". It also turns out she shares one of my incredibly niche interests in something which is incredibly inane for most people which is nice.\n\nFeb 27, 1:14am: I forgot to reply to @Jonathan\u2019s comment, I spent like 20 minutes writing the message, trying very hard to not give it away. You can keep looking for a deeper meaning, but I don\u2019t think most people could discover anything above chance, and I\u2019d urge you to ignore it because it contains post-request information.\n\nFeb 27, 2:57pm: \nSo she left to go back home for the weekend, but she forgot her half-fare card in her room, and she needed it to travel back. I offered to go to her place and mail it back to her. She initially refused because she didn't want to burden me and because her room was a \"complete and utter mess\".\n\nFor the room comment, I pointed out that I'd probably see it messy anyways, which she agreed with, which implies she can see me coming to her place (so far she's only been to my place), and that I don't judge.\n\nIn terms of burdening me, she relented because her mum said (direct quote) \"psychological surveys say doing favours build closer friendships\". Initially I was a bit off-put by this, because it seemed like a bit of a friend-zone, but actually I think this is a good sign if her mum is positive about us being close friends, but I don't really know how much she knows about me.\n\nFor actually getting the half-fare card, she gave me a list of instructions written the way I would (pretty precise and really minute, like enter, turn left, turn right, walk straight etc) and in fact gave me a map of the house to show where her room was.\n\nShe was really thankful I mailed it to her. I noticed an interesting thing, she sent me the photo of the railcard late at night while we were talking, and I said \"I hope you didn\u2019t get up to take the picture \ud83d\ude1d, id prefer if you\u2019d slept lol\", and she mentioned she'd taken the photo yesterday, but \"forgot\" to send it.\nThis is interesting regarding initiation, since she clearly puts effort into making the conversation, but still doesn't initiate very often.\n\nFeb 28, 11:42am: I asked our mutual friend what he thought:\n 0. they have spent 16 h in-person with her.\n1. They thought we were already \u201ca thing\u201d when they met us.\n2. In their discussion with her, they identified what she likes in a guy:\n2.1 \u201cExtroverted but shares some of her interests. Someone who isn\u2019t introverted [a]nd doesn\u2019t spend all the time watching TV or is very awkward\u201d\n3. She told them that she \u201cwasn\u2019t really interested in relationships\u201d\n3.1, They interpret this to mean not that she would reject everyone, but that she isn\u2019t actively seeking anyone, especially because she has some idea of what she\u2019d like in a guy and the fact she wants children.\n4. They approve my plan to ask her out.\n5. They say p is between 50\u201360 %\n5.1 They think the likely outcome is that she will ask me for some time to think about it before saying yes.\n6. Regarding initiation, she doesn\u2019t like to initiate, but she likes to talk to people.\n7. She isn\u2019t the romantic type, so probably wouldn\u2019t be too into hand-holding, hugging etc.\n\nSo 6 confirms what I was thinking, 2.1 is somewhat concerning since I\u2019m not extroverted, but I assume she meant not someone who has low social skills.\n\nI\u2019ll be asking her tomorrow, so get your bets in.\n\nClose date updated to 2022-03-01 12:00 pm\n\nMar 1, 11:57am: So she said no, but she did say when I asked she was only 80 % sure she would say no; ie even she thought it was 20 %. Concerning my %, when the crush started, I thought it was 25 % she liked me, and it later went to 33 % when I asked. Although an interesting trend was people who knew me well would give low %s, like 30 % and later 50 %, whereas people who didn\u2019t would give really high %s like 60-70 % at the start, which seems to be replicated in today\u2019s market (although I did think the market was correcting around feb 23).\n\nI don\u2019t think 79 % is really a realistic %, as the baseline for \u201cdo they like me?\u201d I think would be like 0,1 % by Fermi estimation (assume 100 friends\/acquaintances and people are attracted to someone 10 % of the time), maybe 1 % if people are always attracted to someone. IMO the market really should\u2019ve been at 40 % max. But thanks for believing in me \ud83d\ude0a , and for taking part in this experiment.\n[Market creator] Sam\n[Creation date] 02-22-2022\n[Closing data] 03-01-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"17":["[Market title] Will Manchester City finish with a top 5 position in the Premier League during the 2022-2023 season?\n[Market description] \"Manchester City have been charged by the Premier League over breaking financial rules across nine seasons, the league announced on Monday.\n\nThe Premier League confirmed that a number of alleged breaches between the 2009-10 and 2017-18 seasons have been referred to an independent commission with the conclusion of a four-year investigation.\n\nThe commission will be held in private and can impose open-ended sanctions, which could include fines, points deductions or relegation from the Premier League.\" - ESPN\n\nGiven the potential penalties that Manchester City faces (including the deduction of points or relegation), will the team finish in a top 5 position in the Premier League (as measured by points accumulated)?\n\nThis question will resolve positively if the Premier League website (https:\/\/www.premierleague.com\/) does not (EDIT: see below) list Manchester City as having a top 5 position.\n\nEDIT: the final sentence in the original description seems to contradict the question title and previous sentences in the description.

In his lawsuit, Niemann names Magnus Carlsen, Play Magnus, chess.com, Daniel Rensch, and Hikaru Nakamura as defendants. Neimann alleged that the defendants spread false accusations against him regarding cheating and leveraged their positions to unfairly tarnish his reputation.\n\nRules: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Niemann v. Carlsen (E.D. Mo., 4:22-cv-01110) results in Hans Niemann being entitled to any damages from one or more of the named defendants, regardless of the amount awarded to him, by December 31, 2023 at 11:59PM ET. \n\nDamages must (at minimum) exceed the restitution of legal fees. This market can be immediately resolved once a verdict has been reached in Niemann v. Carlsen. \n\nIf no damages have been awarded to Niemass as a result of Niemann v. Carlsen by December 31, 2023 then the market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nIf the case is settled out of court or otherwise dissolved, then the market can also be immediately resolved to \"No\". \n\nAny appeal of the decision in Niemann v. Carlsen will have no bearing on the resolution of this market, and only the initial verdict by the court will be considered. The market will be resolved based on official reporting from the United States District Court or Eastern District of Missouri, or if necessary, a consensus of credible reporting. \n\nLawsuit Excerpt: \"Accordingly, Niemann asserts the following claims against Defendants: (1) slander; (2) libel; (3) unlawful group boycott under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, et. seq.; (4) tortious interference with contract and business expectancies; and (5) civil conspiracy.

Move 15\n[Market description] This is a match between me and the commenters. Resolves Yes if I checkmate You. Resolve No if I am checkmated or the game ends with a draw. I will not bet. \n\nOne rule is added to the chess ruleset (it consists of two sentences, the second one is just elaboration). \n\nThe rule is \"fair\": it doesn't give advantage to any side, is symmetrical, does not depend on the move index.\n\nThe fact that I know the rule and others do not is the unfair part of the game. Commenters are encouraged to discuss and try to find out the rule during the game. Commenters are allowed to use programs and help from people even outside Manifold, and I am allowed none of that.\n\nAfter each my move I will comment with a picture of the current situation on the board. Team of commenters makes a move, when one makes a comment with the move description (similar to 1:Qa1-a2) and it recieves 3 likes from others. (My likes do not count, so I can't sabotage). If the move is illegal, commenters recieve another chance to make a move (unlimited). There is no time control. But i will try to make my move within 3 days. Closing date might be prolonged, do not take it into account.\n\nTo prove that the rule is created before the market, I've created a github private repo with the rule commited today, which i'll make public at the end if needed.\n\n+Upd. It was suggested to post a hash of the text containing the rule. MD5: 4f17d1b553afe8f7ffeb8cd88b6f2e8b\n\n+Upd2. If you are not planning to commit a move to be voted on and just want to test legality of several moves, you can write up to 5 moves in a single comment.\n\n+Upd3. The legality check is changed. From now there are \"3 potential moves per person per game move\" commenters can check. This is made to prevent spam and bruteforce.\n\n+Upd4. To overcome the \"like bug\" now to show that you vote for a move to be made, make a comment under the suggested move, start with \"+vote \".\n\n+Upd5. I don't want the game to be frozen, so i introduce a new mechanic. After each my move i will tell in the comments 4 valid moves for white: one best, one worst and two mediocre. But that is your job to understand which is what.\n\n(I still do not use computer help, all 4 moves are evaluated by me)\n\nYou DON'T have to choose one of these four, you can still do legality checks and propose your own moves as previously.\n\nClosing date might be prolonged.\n\nI had a peak of 1800 Elo in Lichess classical time control around 4 years ago I think.\n\nCommenters play white.\n\nCurrent position before move 16:\n\n[image]1. e4 b6 \n\n2.

In my original vision (before i added legality checks to speed things up) people would test their hypotheses on the board by moving pieces and seeing results\/my responses and speculating from that. If you were allowed to purely theoretically test them, you would never do experiments on the board. In second match I might invent some other mechanic to replace it, because legality check causes to many attempts to push the boundaries of the original idea. Upd. I wanted to see something like a scientific approach. People make a hypothesis, discuss risks, make move, observe results, adjust theories. With legality checks people immediately can deny hypotheses with no effect on the board.\n---\n[Date]: 07-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  also I want the situation on the board to keep its role.

And that is without legality checks. With legality checks the probability to face the rule is even higher, closer to 1.

The rule guesses count towards the other market \"will sb guess the rule before move 20\" . But the market will resolve after the game finishes, so I don't spill out info. But i've decided to say this: probability of never accidentally hitting \"the rule consequences\" in a match is like 1e-50,  given that one player tries to hide it as long as he can.

He\u2019s either innocent or guilty, and you will have to figure out which, with the help of your fellow Manifolders! We earnestly hope that all will cooperatively seek the correct verdict and avoid bayesian persuasion.\n\nYES to convict\n\nNO to acquit\n\nEvery 2 days, between 7 PM PST and 9 PM PST, the organizers will see which participant holds the largest number of shares in this market (either YES or NO), and ask that participant in the comments to propose a test.\n\nThis test will return \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cinnocent\u201d, but has a certain rate of false negatives, and the selected participant will publicly set these two probabilities.\n\nFor example, if they select \u201c60 guilty\/50 innocent\u201d, then the test will be accurate 60 percent of the time if they are guilty, and will be accurate 50 percent of the time if they are innocent.\n\nThe organizers conduct the test within the next day, and will publicly comment whether the test returned guilty or innocent.\n\nUnfortunately, the court\u2019s most accurate tests take more time to prepare. Initially, tests can have false negatives from 40-60, and with each testing cycle, more accurate tests are possible (35-65 for the second test, 30-70 for the third test, etc.).\u00a0\n\nTommy\u2019s trial will run for 20 days\/10 tests, or until the market is at\/above 99% or at\/below 1% at the time of testing.\n\nThe first day of testing is January 30. The organizers (@KCS , @Nadja_L) have flipped a coin and have taken note of Tommy\u2019s guilt or innocence. Obviously, the organizers will not trade.\n\nTests:\n\n(40-60 permitted, @jcb chose 60\/60): innocent\n\n(35-65 permitted, @jcb chose 65\/65): innocent\n\n(30-70 permitted, @MartinModrak chose 37\/61): guilty\n\n(25-75 permitted, @MartinModrak chose 51\/73): guilty\n\n(20-80 permitted, @prigoryan chose 20\/20): guilty\n\n(15-85 permitted, @yaboi69 chose 85\/50): innocent\n\n(10-90 permitted, @MartinModrak chose 90\/90): guilty\n\n(5-95 permitted, @prigoryan chose 95\/95): guilty\n\n(1-99 permitted, @prigoryan chose 99\/99): guilty\n\n(0-100 permitted, @prigoryan chose 50\/1): innocent\n\n\nClose date updated to 2023-02-19 11:59 pm\n[Market creator] kenakofer\n[Creation date] 01-30-2023\n[Closing data] 02-20-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  ^ This was the code used for RNG.

SBF agrees to extradition to the United States, giving up the opportunity to spend years fighting extradition. The cooperation of two lieutenants with detailed insider knowledge and the rapid extradition to the USA mean that the probability of a conviction before 2026 is very, very high.  The lieutenants can corroborate each other's testimony. Any part of the fraud that was not documented electronically (sometimes on a cryptographically-signed immutable public ledger!) might be explained when Wang and Ellison are cross-examined.  I think the Southern District of New York is playing a very strong hand here. When SDNY tells other FTX executives to come forth and cooperate now, I don't think it's a bluff.

In this case, the course does not guarantee a bunch sprint and it does not guarantee a small group will go to the finish -- so there are a lot of potential ways the race can play out. The top 5 riders listed so far (Remco, Wout, Mathieu, Jasper, Tadej) have confounding factors that make picking them somewhat tricky! Belgium  (Remco, Wout, Jasper) brings a very strong team that should be able to manage the race even if other squads all look at them to do so. But the personal relationship between Remco, Wout, and Jasper seems very tricky to manage -- does the team need to give Wout a free role in the final even if Jasper is still in the group? Will Wout lead out Jasper? Will Wout cover attacks if Remco is up the road? This feels tricky to navigate.  However, if Remco cannot get away in his own move, I do think he would be an excellent teammate in the late stages of a race bound for a sprint finish. Netherlands  (Mathieu) also suffer from a \"too many leaders\" issue in a slightly different way than Belgium does.  If the race truly comes to a bunch sprint finish, is MVDP going to lead out Kooij? Or will MVDP have completely toasted himself attacking before that.  What if Van Baarle and MVDP are both in a late race leading pack and can't decide which one should make the next attack? And then the rest of the squad is still capable, but probably not as capable as Belgium's. Slovenia  (Tadej) has not (that I can find) announced their full team yet, but one of their strongest competitors Mohoric has announced he will not be going to the race.  Pogacar can absolutely be in the lead group at this race no matter how it plays out, but if he misses the right move, he might lack a team that can pull it back to put him in position. --- Overall, I think the favorites so far are good, but there are a LOT of other people out there with their own chances.  If Belgium announces before the race that they are 100% committed to Jasper and no other plans, they would probably be the absolute favorites. That just seems unlikely though, because the teammates Wout and Remco likely also sense a race that they should be able to win.\n","[Market title] How many different riders will wear the yellow jersey in the 2023 Tour de France?\n[Market description] The yellow jersey is worn by the rider who leads the general classification (GC) standings after the last completed stage. If a rider moves into the lead of the GC but fails to start the next stage, they will still be considered to have 'worn the yellow jersey'. In such a case, the rider who takes over as GC leader in their absence will only be counted as a yellow jersey wearer if they actually wear the jersey.\n\nExample: Remco Evenepoel withdrew from this year's Giro d'Italia before stage 10 while leading the GC standings. Geraint Thomas was in 2nd place before Evenepoel's withdrawal. Even if Thomas had not been GC leader after stage 10, he would still be considered to have worn the leader's jersey since he decided to wear it on stage 10 itself.\n\nFurthermore, if the jersey changes hands on the final stage, the rider leading the GC standings after the stage will be considered a yellow jersey wearer.\n\nThe market will close on the first rest day, 10 July.\n[Market creator] Eoghan\n[Creation date] 05-31-2023\n[Closing data] 07-10-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-31-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  As an aside, the yellow jersey changing hands on the Champs Elysees would mean we'd be in for a very exciting Tour!\n---\n[Date]: 05-31-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good question.

In the absence of something like that there is going to still be a chance of Yes up to likely a week before.  I'm curious to see if he shows up at the National Championships for a potential meeting with Pogacar. Before the Giro my assumption was there was a significant chance he would either not start or not finish the Giro due to injury, illness, crash, whatever. If any of those roadblocks happened, he would have been much more likely to start the Tour. But now that the Giro has finished and nothing happened, I was really expecting this to shift from 25-30% range down to the 10-15% range quickly. So far it didn't happen yet but it seems the Yes side are very enthusiastic still. My overall position is around 22% and I'm still happy with that -- Jumbo Visma wants to win the Tour and Roglic is the very best rider\/helper that any team could add to their squads.

And for most of my life, this has been a one-way relationship filled with disappointment and heartache. Sure, we\u2019ll always have Nick Foles and the \u201cPhilly Special\u201d at Super Bowl 52 (though my favorite memory from that game isn\u2019t Foles catching a pass; it\u2019s then-Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dropping one). But this is a franchise with an all-time loss record of .490 as of the end of 2021, one tick lower than the Cleveland Browns. The Browns!\n\nThis year has been different, though. With a 13-2 record as of the last week of December, my Eagles sit at the top of the NFL. We have an exciting young quarterback in Jalen Hurts, a trio of elite wide receivers who all for some reason have Batman-related nicknames, and a left offensive tackle approximately the size of two Jason Momoas. At of December 27, the sportsbooks at Fanduel put the odds of an Eagles win in Super Bowl LVII at 16.9 percent. That\u2019s just behind the Kansas City Chiefs at about 18.2 percent and the Buffalo Bills at 22.2 percent, but I\u2019m going to give the Eagles a boost on the basis of my \u201cnothing good happens to Buffalo\u201d theory, which historically has been very accurate, and because Philadelphia fans are familiar with Chiefs coach Andy Reid\u2019s inability to read a game clock. And should the Eagles fail, I can offer a prediction with 100 percent certainty: We will boo them. \u2014BW\n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 02-13-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"28":["[Market title] Will there be at least 3 more people holding YES shares than holding NO shares at market close?\n[Market description] Omits accounts with the \"bot\" tag.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 02-13-2023\n[Closing data] 02-20-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-20-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]: Well, GG friends.\n---\n[Date]: 02-20-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Upping my offer to 100% of profits. :)\n---\n[Date]: 02-19-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  It's almost like I have a prediction market at my fingertips to tell me the exact odds!\n---\n[Date]: 02-19-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  There have been some pretty big last-minute switches in the past.

Background here.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, significant regulatory action includes, but is not necessarily limited to:\n\nThe issuance of a public Official Warning (the existence of a report is not sufficient, the term \"Official Warning\" must be used in a statement or report by the CC);\n\nInvoluntary removal of, or appointment of, an EVF trustee (voluntary resignation or appointments do not count);\n\nDisqualification of an EVF trustee from serving as a charity trustee or senior manager for a period of time (this does include \"voluntary\" undertakings not to serve in these roles);\n\nAppointment of an Interim Manager for any length of time;\n\nMost other temporary protective powers, if they exceed 3 months' duration and are not clearly minor in scope;\n\nAlmost all permanent protective powers; and\n\nAn order directing the winding up of EVF UK's affairs.\n\nSee this document for more information about the CC's regulatory powers, and ask if this description is unclear on what I consider to be a \"significant\" regulatory action. I do not intend to defer resolving the market pending any appeals outside the CC.\n[Market creator] Jason\n[Creation date] 01-31-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2026\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  The starting point is that \"voluntary resignation or appointments do not count.\" That we think the CC ahem,  encouraged  a resignation does not matter. There are too many reasons to resign that are not \"because the CC was going to make me.\" The sentence about voluntary undertakings not to serve \"as a charity trustee or senior manager for a period of time\" refers to commitments not to serve in those roles in the entire UK charity sector. I've seen such commitments in CC reports -- I assume the CC accepts resignation and a commitment as equivalent to a disqualification from serving in those roles in the UK charity sector. And there's no other clear reason for someone to make that commitment. If someone agreed to resign and committed to never be on the EVF board again . . I think that is a YES if  and only if  the commitment is explicitly mentioned in the CC report. Only then would I be satisfied of enough nexus to threat it like the previous paragraph. \n---\n[Date]: 02-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  or someone else: Can someone point me to a resource explaining how much liquidity a market \"should\" have to function in a reasonably effective way?\n---\n[Date]: 02-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Are you going to do one for Nick, or do you think the two are so linked that is duplicative?\n---\n[Date]: 02-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think there's an excellent chance MacAskill and Beckstead go, but by market definition that's only a significant regulatory action if not \"voluntary\" or if there is commitment not to serve as a charity trustee or senior manager for a period of time. The many-hatted nature of many senior EA leaders' role complicates all of this. Much of what these folks did was not in their capacity as a board member or agent of EVF. So we'd mainly be looking at whether their actions were disloyal to EVF. It's not obvious to me how being pro-SBF would be disloyal to EVF without more; EVF had an interest in keeping its megadonor happy and maximally wealthy. Much ink has been spilled on the EA Forum as to whether EVF's board should go and whether broader structural reforms are warranted, and opinions are mixed.\n---\n[Date]: 02-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Close call, but not in this case.

(i.e., the non-profit entity associated with the Future Fund) receive a demand to give the money back (e.g., to be distributed among FTX bankruptcy creditors)?\n[Market description] As almost all of you have likely heard, FTX, FTX US, and Alameda will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. \n\nThe FTX Future Fund gave away grants to many recipients.\n\nThe question is, by 2028, will at least 50% of U.S. based distinct entities that received those grants via the FTX Foundation, Inc. (received within the past 90 days of the date of bankruptcy filing) have their money attempted to be \"clawed back\" - in the sense that they are told (e.g., by a court order or letter from the FTX entities or letter from creditors) that they have to give back the money (e.g., to be redistributed among bankruptcy creditors)?  \n\nThis is NOT an estimate of whether such projects would be forced to give the money back if they were to defend themselves in court, only whether they will receive such a demand (e.g., via a letter from the FTX entities).\n\nSome relevant links:\n\nhttps:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/o8B9kCkwteSqZg9zc\/thoughts-on-legal-concerns-surrounding-the-ftx-situation\n\n\"Essentially, if you received money from an FTX entity in the debtor group anytime on or after approximately August 11, 2022, the bankruptcy process will probably ask you, at some point, to pay all or part of that money back\"\n\nAnd:\n\n'[L]egal experts argue that even if these funds were proven to be linked to wrongdoing, there probably would be no legal basis for clawbacks.

(at the bottom of the chart) as being unconnected to the other entities.\n\nThe FTX Foundation Inc. seems to have Delaware file number \u00a06586501, which, when I search for it in the Delaware corporate database (https:\/\/icis.corp.delaware.gov\/eCorp\/EntitySearch\/NameSearch.aspx) with a different name - \u00a0FTX PHILANTHROPY, INC. - but this entity is also not in the bankruptcy filing from what I can tell, and I think not on the corporate structure chart mentioned above either.\n\nSo, what is \u00a0FTX Foundation Inc.? Here (https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/2mx6xrDrwiEKzfgks\/announcing-the-future-fund-1?commentId=qtJ7KviYxWiZPubtY), one of the people running the Future Fund says:\n\n\"We have a number of entities we can use to provide funding, and which we use depends on the exact circumstances.

The only possibility of a Yes resolution is if  only Alameda  was able to bypass Cloudflare (SBF defence  says no , the prosecution didn't say it was only allowed for Alameda), which would make it Alameda's advantage in sending API requests to place orders, AND the commonly used definition of \" trade execution \" includes  not just the mechanism of picking an order  to fill from a queue ,  but also to the formation of the queue, for that advantage to count as a priority in trade execution. A friend doing HFT told me it's a common practice for exchanges to have dedicated IPs for traders with large volumes, and if anyone can satisfy the criteria and get a dedicated IP to place orders without Cloudflare, and there are companies who did that, this should resolve to No. If no one except for Alameda was able to place orders without Cloudflare, it's likely I'll resolve this to Yes, pending someone clarifying the whole what \"priority in trade execution\" means\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  well, that doesn\u2019t update me at all.

Is \"priority\" referring just to the execution mechanism, once the trades are placed, or does it include the time it takes to place the trades? IIRC, Alameda could use the API without CloudFlare in between, which meant it could place trades faster. I think this happens on traditional exchanges as well- trading firms try to get as little delay as possible, including making agreements and placing servers next to the exchange, but while they place trades faster, there's no priority in trade execution. Not sure if it's also the case here- I guess the FTX engine could've prioritised Alameda's trades.

Also, I am not familiar with how these bureaucracies work, but things always seem to come together last minute, like a chess game where someone finally takes a piece and triggers a series of exchanges in rapid sucession. It would not surprise me if SpaceX hasn't officially submitted a report, but they've shared a draft, and the FAA haven't officially given the list of corrective actions, but they've shared an indicative list, and basically SpaceX will implement the corrective actions, and then all the drafts will become final documents and be submitted and responded to in quick sucession. I don't know if that's how it works, but it seems like it sometimes. In any case the current vibe seems to be about SpaceX implementing corrective actions, which implies previous steps about identifying these actions have in practice already taken place, whether yet official or not.\n---\n[Date]: 09-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  The wording here is about them implementing stuff and demonstrating compliance with stuff, not submitting paperwork.

If we liked we could set a threshold for \"near orbital\" like that it has to reach 95% of the speed required for a 160km circular orbit, or something like that. Where as you said it's the plan that counts, not the outcome. I think the target trajectory will probably put Starship somewhere between 99.5% and 100% of the speed that would be needed for a 160km circular orbit (though it won't be a circular orbit), so it's getting so close that whether it reaches orbital speed will depend on exactly what you consider to be the lowest realistic orbit (I've picked 160km for the below question, but 150km is also a defensible choice)\n","[Market title] Will a Starship orbital flight attempt occur on April 17th, 2023?\n[Market description] Resolution criteria for what counts as an attempt copied from this market.\n\nFor the purposes of this market the test doesn't have to be successful or even conclusive - a scrub is fine as long as it's clear that SpaceX was trying to do an orbital flight test.\n\nI'll resolve YES if an official SpaceX social media channel puts up a livestream entitled \"Starship Orbital Flight Test\", \"Starship Orbital Launch\", or similar, which shows a live feed of Starship and a countdown, NO if there is clearly no such livestream by market close, and N\/A if it is ambiguous whether this has happened at market close.\n\nApril 17th refers to local time at the launch site.\n\n\nNote: if there is a successful launch or vehicle destruction prior to the 17th, I will resolve this market NO immediately.\n\n\n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-starships-orbital-test-flight \n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-starships-orbital-flight-test \n\n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-a-starship-orbital-flight-atte-883c2b0587e9  (you are here)\n\n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-a-starship-orbital-flight-atte-0becacaa1884 \n\n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-a-starship-orbital-flight-atte-1bf5c0002512 \n\n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-a-starship-orbital-flight-atte-bd3fb4f7bd63 \n\n@\/chrisjbillington\/will-a-starship-orbital-flight-atte-a5458089285c \n\n\n[Market creator] Chris Billington\n[Creation date] 04-06-2023\n[Closing data] 04-17-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Another market:  \n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Some more markets:    \n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Sorry, yep that's right.\n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Something fell inside the launch tower at 1:57:20 (visible on  LabPadre's rover cam ), leaving a trail of sparks and making a loud noise impacting the ground.

They're  not  going to do a rehearsal: And there's a page on spacex's website containing details for the launch: https:\/\/www.spacex.com\/launches\/mission\/?missionId=starship-flight-test On the main SpaceX launches page, the test is dated Apr 17th. https:\/\/www.spacex.com\/launches\/ \/r\/SpaceX users report that the SpaceX YouTube channel briefly had a live stream for the launch (before being set to private), scheduled to go live at 6:15AM Texas time. The timeline on the launch page says the stream will go live 45m before launch, so this is consistent with a 7am launch. I initially sold all my NO on this, but bought some back after reading further - it seems to me that whilst this is the earliest possible launch and therefore what they're working towards, Elon's comments about the launch being more probable later in the week likely still stand.\n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n"],"31":["[Market title] How many anti-trans laws will be enacted in the United States in 2023?\n[Market description] This question resolves as the number of anti-trans laws (as counted by https:\/\/translegislation.com\/ ) that are enacted by state governments within the United States (or, less likely, the federal government) at any point during 2023.\n\nAs of October 29, 2023, 583 anti-trans bills have been introduced in legislatures across the country. Of these, 373 are active, 125 have failed, and 85 have passed. Of these, 84 have been signed and enacted into law, for an average of roughly 8.5 anti-trans bills enacted per month. The others have not been signed or vetoed by their respective governors yet.\n\nIn 2022, 174 anti-trans bills were introduced in legislatures. Of these, 142 failed and 26 were enacted into law, for an average of 2 anti-trans bills enacted per month. So far, the rate in 2023 is five times higher.\n\nAccording to Trans Legislation Tracker, \"2023 marks the fourth consecutive record-breaking year for anti-trans legislation in the U.S.,\" with more bills focusing on denial of gender-affirming healthcare, control of education (e.g. banning pro-trans topics, not allowing students to be out at school but not at home), and \"drag bans\" that primarily target trans people. A federal bill that would prevent the government from recognizing the existence of trans people at all has, as of May 2023, 25 sponsors in the House of Representatives (though the bill cannot pass the Senate, probably cannot pass the House, and would be vetoed by Biden anyways). \n\nAny anti-trans bill that is enacted into law in 2023 counts, even if it is later repealed or struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nIf Trans Legislation Tracker no longer exists as of January 1, 2024, I will find another reputable source to count the number of anti-trans bills signed into law in 2023. I will try to keep the data cited above relevant by updating it at least once a month. The resolution criteria of this question will not change. As the website that will be used to resolve this question is publicly available, and the question resolves based on objective criteria, I will bet on this market. I don't believe anything could cause this market to resolve as N\/A, nor as a number below 84; I think it is unlikely for it to resolve above 200, but went for a larger range (up to 250) out of an abundance of caution.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 05-01-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] The Supreme Court will rule that affirmative action is unconstitutional [Vox prediction \u2014 READ DESCRIPTION AND COMMENTS]\n[Market description] This is one of Vox's Future Perfect predictions for 2023; they give it a 70% probability.\n\nMy colleague Ian Millhiser listened to the oral arguments in the Students for Fair Admissions cases challenging affirmative action at both the University of North Carolina and Harvard, and left persuaded that explicit racial preferences for admission are a goner: \u201cEven if one of the conservative justices who expressed some reservations today surprises us,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat would still likely leave five votes teed up against affirmative action.\u201d\n\n\nThat makes sense. As Millhiser notes, there are six Republican appointees on the Court today, all by presidents opposed to affirmative action and all reared in a conservative legal movement where opposition to the policy is taken for granted. Even the most comparatively moderate of them, Chief Justice John Roberts, is famously hostile to considering race in attempts to address past discrimination.\n\n\nThe reason I\u2019m not more confident is due to a nuance Millhiser noted, which is that Roberts appeared open to racial preferences at military academies, noting the federal government\u2019s argument that the military needs a diverse officer corps to succeed. If such a carve-out is included in the ultimate ruling, my prediction here will be wrong: I\u2019m predicting they\u2019ll strike down affirmative action across the board at public or publicly funded institutions. \n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 09-27-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: ok I'll resolve this \u2014 if it ends up being judged in the end of year writeup, we can reresolve, but that seems unlikely to me\n---\n[Date]: 09-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  is there public evidence that he thinks it's wrong?\n---\n[Date]: 09-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Why?

If they think the military-academy stuff goes against their prediction, and judge that they were wrong, this market will resolve NO. (Though of course, the decision  did  ban racial affirmative action at the vast majority of US colleges.)\n","[Market title] Will my partner or I experience transphobia while moving states?\n[Market description] This market resolves as YES if, at any point during our travel from the state where we currently live to the state where we will be living to attend grad school, my partner or I personally experience transphobia. Otherwise, this market resolves as NO upon us moving into our new apartment.\n\nBecause driving from our current state to our future state would take 38 hours of driving going only through blue states versus about 21 hours going mostly through red states, we'll almost certainly end up driving through some combination of two to four red states, all of which are among the most conservative places in the country. In particular, it is illegal for me to use the women's bathroom in one of the states, and probably illegal in another. The remaining states are highly conservative, which means even if I can't be arrested for using the women's bathroom, I'm at an elevated risk of being yelled at, chased out, threatened with violence, etc.\n\nMy partner is nonbinary, but is not visibly trans. I pass as a woman most of the time, but not always (and as I live in a progressive area, it's entirely possible that people have been \"clocking\" me as a trans woman and referring to me with the correct pronouns out of respect.)\n\nThis market resolves as YES using a common-sense definition of transphobia. That is to say: something must happen that causes me physical harm or significant emotional distress\/dysphoria, and it must be a direct result of anti-trans policies or someone openly discriminating against me because I am trans. Possible YES resolutions include:\n\nBeing arrested or harassed for using the bathroom that conforms with my gender identity rather than my sex assigned at birth\n\nBeing forced to use the bathroom that conforms with my sex assigned at birth due to fear of being arrested (being harassed is quite likely; as I said, I typically pass as a woman.)\n\nVerbal abuse from a stranger because I am trans - could include slurs, mockery, etc. (NOTE: This only counts verbal abuse directed at me or my partner from someone who is physically nearby; random transphobic comments on my social media, random transphobic texts, etc. do not count.)\n\nPhysical abuse from a stranger because I am trans - includes any action taken to harm me or my property (would include someone keying my car etc.)\n\nIn the (hopefully very, very unlikely) event that I am literally murdered as a result of transphobic violence, this market resolves as YES. \n\nVerbal or physical abuse that is not provably tied to my status as a trans woman - e.g. being honked at, having non-discriminatory insults yelled at me, being punched for apparently no reason - are not sufficient for a YES resolution unless I have strong reason to believe they happened as a direct result of me being trans. \n\nIf an incident sufficient for a YES resolution occurs, I will post a short summary of the incident in the comments shortly after resolving YES. I probably won't be able to provide proof, so you'll need to trust me. To ensure I have no incentive to lie, I won't bet on this market and will have no personal stake in its outcome (other than obviously hoping it resolves as NO.)\n\nThe close date is set to August 28, since that's when my partner and I will be moving in to our new apartment. It's very possible that this market might resolve a day or so in advance of that.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 06-03-2023\n[Closing data] 08-28-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"32":["[Market title] Should Manifold not list some charities?

Every year, the Effective Altruism community coordinates around posting videos for charities chosen ahead of time. From https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/aGLiq389hAzC2g6KA\/project-for-awesome-2021-was-a-success-1, the historical amounts won by EA charities is: * 2021: Likely total of $189,700. ~$27,000 for The Against Malaria Foundation, The Good Food Institute, GiveDirectly, Clean Air Task Force, The Humane League, Givewell Maximum Impact Fund, and Wild Animal Initiative. * 2020: No P4A this year - it was moved from December 2020 to February 2021. * 2019: Total of $58,804.40. At least $14,701.10 for The Against Malaria Foundation, The Good Food Institute, GiveDirectly, and Clean Air Task Force. * 2018: Total of $55,891.44. $18,630.48 for The Against Malaria Foundation, The Good Food Institute, and GiveDirectly. * 2017: Total of $39,436. $19,718 for The Against Malaria Foundation and GiveDirectly. * 2016: Total of $50,000. $25,000 for The Against Malaria Foundation and The Good Food Institute. * 2015: $25,000 for The Against Malaria Foundation. This will resolve YES if the total amount given to EA charities according to http:\/\/www.fightworldsuck.org\/previous-grants\/ when results for 2022 are available is greater than or equal to $50,000. The EA charities that the community is coordinating on will be some subset Fortify Health, Animal Ethics, Fish Welfare Initiative, Rethink Priorities, Charity Entrepreneurship, The Good Food Institute, One For The World, Wild Animal Initiative, The Humane League, Against Malaria Foundation, Happier Lives Institute, Givewell, Maximum Impact Fund, Mercy For Animals, High Impact Athletes and 80,000 Hours; if another clearly EA charity (eg top recommended GiveWell charity, Animal Charity Evaluators top charity, GiveWell incubation grant recipient) seems likely to win money from Project for Awesome, I will discuss whether to count that.

For the FR questions, however, there were way too many for me to finish on time and I ended up leaving a few untouched. The ones that I did solve were the ones I was more confident about, however.

As my plan said, I was studying for CS this past week and will probably not be studying until maybe Monday or Tuesday (and even then, maybe it'll be a practice test but nothing too rigorous). I took a practice test last night, but I started at 11:30 and by the time I finished my Multiple Choice questions I was too tired to think (and relatedly, I scored really bad on those). I went to bed and woke up this morning, and the first thing I did was start the Free-Response questions (so no studying in between, but there was a difference in mental ability as well as just a time gap). I did much better on these and was able to get a 5 (somewhat narrowly). I graded myself somewhat harshly in my opinion but there were definitely things that could've been harsher. Today I start Stats!\n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Update: Just to reiterate- I'm taking CS A, Stats, and Calc. CS A is next Wednesday, and I plan to do most of my studying for this test from now until Friday. I have a book that I'm going through and I think it's pretty good. Everything seems to be pretty easy and even the practice tests that I've glanced at seem to be okay. I have enough resources for this (I think) and I should be able to finish the book by Friday. I then plan to take a practice test or two before the test (I'll take at least one for sure) and review accordingly. I expect to score a 5 if all goes to plan. Stats is next Thursday. I've taken a class on Stats this entire year, and according to my teacher, we have two units left: chi-squares and slopes. I asked my teacher and they said that a lot of the material we've gone over isn't the \"mindset\" of the AP tests and one should take at minimum three practice tests before then. I'm basically spending the entire weekend studying for Stats, and will also take a practice test- probably on Monday or Tuesday. I would like to take at least two tests as this would be better for me. I have no clue how to use the calculator for stats (I'm working on that) and my current resources are a book and Khan Academy. I plan to primarily use the book, but I expect I'll use Khan Academy at some point. The book has enough practice tests for me to take. I expect to get at least a 3, and depending on how much I can get done, I think it's possible for me to get a 4. Calc is in two Wednesdays. I took calc last year and since have forgotten quite a lot. I plan to study for Calc after next Thursday, so I'll hopefully have a few days to do so. I think the AP I have to study the most for is Calc, but I've reviewed most of the concepts that I forgot entirely and so I have higher hopes for this one than for Stats. I am using Khan Academy (I didn't mention it before but it's a wonderful resource) but unfortunately, I lost my Calc book somewhere in my house and cannot find it. In the event that I do not find it sometime soon, I will have to blindly go into the exam without having taken a good practice test. I have old packets of practice tests from years past and can find some online but the grading and platform are suboptimal. I still expect to score a 5 if all goes to plan, but a 4 is definitely possible. (I'm kinda worried about the free response.) TL;DR: I should do good enough on Calc and CS A, but Stats is a little concerning.\n---\n[Date]: 04-21-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  yeah so i was wrong- i'm taking CS A\n---\n[Date]: 04-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  \ud83d\ude2d \n","[Market title] Will I get 80% or above in my Complex Analysis Final Exam (on June 8th)?\n[Market description] This is a primarily motivational market and my betting does not reflect my own beliefs about how well I'll do.

My super-subjective view is that this market is slightly overpriced right now; however, given how poorly calibrated I seem to be w\/r\/t questions about my own life, I defer to the market on this one! While I'm very reluctant to go into much more public detail than I  already have  about my health in the comment section of a random (if delightful & remarkably friendly!) forecasting website, I also really value having an external assessment \u2014 and,  as I've said before , I subsidised liquidity on this market in the hopes of encouraging accuracy.

The timeline you're outlining there is basically what my supervisor and I agreed on. She seems much more confident than I am in \"not many edits needed\" based on what she's seen so far of my earlier notes, drafts, papers etc. My plan is to get preliminary edits (per chapter) from August thru October, then spend November tightening & doing additional edits, and then submit. 2. I expect no structural edits \u2014 the chapter outlines are basically in place \u2014 but do expect two rounds of edits. 3. All of the writing I'm doing is drawing on existing notes & significantly more chaotic drafts. Me saying this probably gives you a false impression, though, as I've found my notes\/drafts pretty much all need rewriting to be useful: there's not much copy\/pasting, unfortunately, and a lot of \"turning 2000 words of nested dot points into 500 words of coherent prose\".  4. I see three main sources of risk:    - Health. I've pushed myself pretty hard to complete a tonne of non-thesis work (also with my supervisor) over the past few months, and that's definitely highlighted the fact that my health still isn't at 100%. The fact that I've been able to push myself so hard is a good sign, but I'm conscious of the fact that I'm planning on an extended period of  intense  work while still having migraine & fatigue issues that are pretty significant compared to Me From Three Years Ago.    - Reconnecting with the literature. I feel extremely apprehensive about having spent so long not adding any words to The Thesis Document, especially given the pace of some of the work related to my thesis topic. I don't currently have a good sense of how much of a time\/attention penalty I'll need to pay for my distance.    - Paperwork. There's a lot of bureaucratic requirements that need to be met before any thesis submission, and the process has changed at my university recently. At this point, I'm kinda just trusting that my supervisors & I haven't missed anything in the new process. Given the horror stories I've heard from some friends\/colleagues, though, my sense is that a single missed form\/requirement \u2014 discovered from this point onwards \u2014 could be more than enough of a time suck to derail a December submission.\n---\n[Date]: 07-10-2023\n[Likes] 5\n[Text]:  The thesis aims to develop a more precise account of 'representations' in artificial neural networks. (I'm in a weird interdisciplinary space, but mostly CS & Philosophy.) At a super high level, I'm arguing that \u2014 if we take the current 'mechanistic interpretability' literature seriously \u2014 we need a new vocabulary for describing the internal contents of trained models & what 'objects' those contents map to. While lots of the philosophy work in epistemology \/ 'models in science' was useful when describing 'simpler' models, that work is not fit-for-purpose when describing ANN architectures. Trying to use common 'philosophy of scientific modelling' vocabulary causes people to be predictably confused & surprised (in practice) when dealing with current state of the art models. I argue that most of the reason the existing frameworks fail is because of equivocation \/ loose talk about what counts as a 'representation'.\n---\n[Date]: 07-09-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  Yes!

I think this assumes that people (like me) are using markets (like this) as  motivation  in a narrow sense. When I put a 20k subsidy & committed to not betting on the market, I was mostly trying to incentivise information processing that I knew I was personally going to be bad at doing. I get value from having an independently-generated handicap on my chances of achieving a goal like this. (I also notice some amount of incidental motivation to act in a way that \"moves the market\" in the direction I want it to move, which I wouldn't get if the proposition was \"bet against me\".) In this case, don't need to up the  stakes  on my phd completion or incentivise myself using mana, but I can get huge benefits from having an outside view on a project that I'm way \"too close to\" to be well-calibrated on.\n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  Thanks for the support!

My wife, friends, family, and supervisors are all very supportive of this goal. As I understand it, the nature of my scholarship\/position also means that my department gets paid a lump sum by the Australian government  when I submit , so there's a sense in which my immediate colleagues (who've invested resources in me) are incentivised to see me complete. Some other context: I'm considering setting up a script to publicly log 'words written per day' (or similar) to give forecasters more information.

Both services have been expanding their reach to include broader swaths of the city, with Waymo now covering ~80% of SF and Cruise (reportedly) covering the entire city.

Was this outcome foreseeable or was there just not enough info available to the public for traders to be more accurate?\n---\n[Date]: 05-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: A new Waymo  blog post  was released today. The post was primarily focused on Arizona, but it also indicated that Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach would be newly approved neighborhoods for Trusted Testers, and that they would be focusing efforts on growing ridership and increasing SF capacity over the next few months.  For this market to resolve positively due to Waymo, IMO the primary crux involves the timing of the approval that Waymo needs to receive from the California Public Utilities Commission to offer paid rides in SF. See this market on whether that will happen by June: They say they have thousands of SF residents using the platform and tens of thousands more people on the waitlist. Besides timing for the CPUC permit, the open questions seem to be: If riding volume declines significantly once it costs money (which is to be expected), and there is limited demand outside of the current waitlist (which seems unlikely), then the path to meeting volume demand for SF residents could be relatively short. \n","[Market title] Will a robot be created that is capable of passing Steve Wozniak's \"The Coffee Test\" before 2040?\n[Market description] Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple Inc., proposed \"The Coffee Test\" as a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of autonomous robots.

He launched a brutal and illegal war that made his nation an international pariah; the resulting sanctions and mass mobilization of young men from that war are wreaking havoc on an economy that\u2019s also suffering from now-falling oil prices. On top of all that, he\u2019s losing that war to a country with less than a third of Russia\u2019s population. All of these are conditions where coups start to become imaginable.\n\n\nThat said, it\u2019s important to keep \u201cbase rates\u201d in mind: How common are coups in dictatorships, generally? A 2021 paper from John Chin, David Carter, and Joseph Wright looked through a database of coup attempts and found that in autocratic countries, 6.3 percent of years featured a coup attempt. \u201cRegime change coups,\u201d their term for attempted coups that totally change a country\u2019s governance structure (as opposed to, say, replacing one general with another), are much more common in personalist regimes like Putin\u2019s, with attempts in 7 percent of years. But in general, only 48 percent of coup attempts they studied succeeded.\n\n\nThis paper might lead one to think there\u2019s perhaps a 3.5 percent chance of a successful regime-change coup against Putin in a given year (and it\u2019s hard to imagine a coup against him that doesn\u2019t constitute a regime change). Given all the stressors listed above, I think that\u2019s much too low an estimate.

If people believe that we should go with a different more general definition rather than the original specification then that may be the best choice since many interpretated the market based on that. Sorry if it\u2019s all a little unclear.

I don\u2019t think Pizohan did what he did to try to overthrow the government. I think he did it to get negotiations deal, which is what ended up happening. I\u2019ll admit this is conjecture but I can\u2019t see a world where Pizhoran honestly would think he could overthrow the government using 25k men and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s stupid enough to attempt such a thing in earnest. As a result, I don\u2019t consider this a coup according to my initial definition.\n---\n[Date]: 06-24-2023\n[Likes] 9\n[Text]: Okay everyone I have a decision. Given that the conflict has ended for now with no attempt at replacing Putin, I\u2019m not going to count this. What has happened was a show of force that ended in a compromise. If I had to guess, that was always Pizhroans goal as he must know he couldn\u2019t take on the Russian military with 25k men. Now, that being said, the fact that he was able to threaten military violence against the state and didn\u2019t get his head cut off is a big deal. In fact, he was able to get a compromise out of it, which means confidence in Putins regime to maintain his power will be at an all time low. This isn\u2019t the end of what\u2019s happened. While Wagner may have not started a coup, this could easily be the trigger to someone else taking advantage of the opportunity they created. Since this poll has till the end of the year, I will wait to see if someone else acts and tries to exploit this vulnerability. I would not be shocked if this is the beginning of the end for Putin, even if that revolution doesn\u2019t happen until after 2023. Regardless, for now, I won\u2019t end this poll as I think that a serious coup has not be attempted. If something happens to change that, then this poll will close accordingly.

(I think there's a small but non-negligible chance that the decimals will make a difference, but regardless, it's better to clarify sooner rather than later.) To explain the rationale, first some context: The price graph shows the order book midprice. By default it is rounded (e.g. 4.5 rounds to 5). With the decimals setting, it shows the exact price. (This is all to the best of our knowledge, if there are any inaccuracies please let me know, but it won't change the current decision.) The rationale is that the true underlying price is the exact one, not the rounded one. And given that there is a display option that allows you to show the exact price instead of the rounded price, it makes more sense to resolve based on the exact price. The main counterargument is that this would be using a non-default setting for the displayed price graph. However, on balance using the non-rounded price seems more in line with both the spirit and the letter of the question. It's also worth noting, the exact prices of YES and NO do appear to always add up to 100%. They only were off because of rounding, as mentioned above. So using the exact price means that YES and NO prices are symmetric, whereas if we used the rounded prices there could be a situation where YES shows 5% while NO shows 96% - we already decided that this question would resolve only on the YES price, but it's nice that with the exact prices they are actually symmetric and there's no difference between YES<5 and NO>95.\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Thanks! In that case, this also explains why we noticed that YES and NO didn't add up to 100% - what was happening was that if the midpoint of the order book was YES = 5.5% and NO = 94.5%, it would round both up to show YES = 6% and NO = 95%, unless you turned the decimal options on. (The fact that it didn't add up to 100% was why I thought it must be something other than the order book midpoint, now that I know it's rounded it all makes sense.)\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 0\n[Text]: I'll also note, the Polymarket trades on this market are at integer prices. So I actually don't know exactly what the price graph means and why it sometimes shows e.g. 5.5% if you enable the decimals option. If anyone knows, please let me know!\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 6\n[Text]: That's a nice idea in theory but when you break it down you realize it's full of problems. For one, what does \"actual %\" mean? This is clear on Manifold but on most other markets (polymarket, stock markets, etc) it can be quite ambiguous! Another issue is, how do you make sure the historical data for that is available and easy to check? This is why I specifically set the resolution criteria for this question based on the price graph - because that way everyone is looking at the same data and there is a clear historical record of the data. (I did not realize Polymarket had options that changed the graph display, otherwise I would have of course specified whether the options would or would not be used.) There are other ways this market could have been specified - for example, based on the raw transaction prices - but there are significant disadvantages to that, such as the fact that it's harder for everyone to check that data - it's there but it's not immediately readable the way the graph is.\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Thanks for pointing out the decimals setting.

I will base my opinion on the consensus of expert condensed matter researchers. \n\n[link preview]Edit 2022-08-01 15:23:00 EST:\n\nTo clarify further, the \"Some type of superconductor, but not at room temperature with near-ambient pressure.\" is NOT going to be the winner. It is not mutually exclusive with the other options, degrading the market. You can sell it down to zero for free Mana. Do NOT buy that option.\n\nIf the Meissner effect videos were taken with the material super-cooled, and the material is otherwise uninteresting I will rule as \"a complete fabrication\". If the videos were taken super-cooled. and the material is a powerful diamagnet at room temp, I will resolve diamagnet. \n\nEDIT 2022-08-01 15:37 EST:\n\nMy goal is for the top choices at the end to be mutually exclusive and reasonably comprehensive. To that end, I may introduce new choices that are more descriptive and mutually exclusive and\/or choose to NOT resolve in favor of existing choices. For example, if someone points out (hypothetically) that Type I and Type III SC's are not mutually exclusive or something, I may create a new option that rescues mutual exclusivity and choose NOT to pick either of those options. In addition, if there is a new option that comes to light in peer review, I am likely to make an option for it -- rather than letting the market simply resolve as \"Other\".\n\nEDIT 2022-08-08 00:04:00 EST\n\nConsider the three types of magnetism as a set S = {diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism}. The lack of a specific member of set S in an answer choice is understood to mean its absence in LK-99. I will also resolve the question in favor of the most specific descriptor. For example, if LK-99 is found to be ferromagnetic and powerfully diamagnetic, I will resolve in favor of the answer choice that has both of these. If the amount of a certain kind of magnetism is de minimis (ie non-exotic, commonly found in other materials), I may ignore it. For example, if LK-99 is only very slightly paramagnetic, I may choose to ignore that aspect of it in determining the answer.\n\nEDIT 2022-08-29 19:30:00 EST\n\nThis paper suggests to me that LK-99 is in the normal range of diamagnetism for an insulator, but shows an interesting amount of ferromagnetism (which would be an important component in explaining the partial levitation). The research was done to a high standard and the purity is unsurpassed per XRD, so this is pretty strong evidence (albeit not conclusive). I'm unlikely to resolve this market until we see peer reviewed papers. \n\nhttps:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2308.06256.pdf\n\nNotably, if we see superconductivity when synthesized as a thin film, I will likely resolve in favor of one of the superconducitivity choices -- even if the bulk material is conclusively shown to not be superconducting.\n[Market creator] aashiq\n[Creation date] 08-01-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-18-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Note, I am NOT going to delay resolution of this market.

Wherever you see \"diamagnetic\" in the choices, you can mentally substitute \"powerfully diamagnetic\".

XRD and EPS seems like a good way of defining LK-99. However, it would be a bit sad if LK-99 is actually the wrong material or something, and LKK have some slightly different material that superconducts as a thin film with a different structure.

LK-99 is described as anisotropic in the OG papers. If true, the superconducting properties should depend on the internal structure being homogeneous AND the orientation of the sample being correct with respect to the applied current. The measurements in the OG papers were done on a thin film of LK-99.  Why doesn't the sample levitate fully and exhibit flux pinning?  It is a 1-D superconductor. See below. Magnetism exerts torque that rotates the sample until the flux that is normal to the sample is at equilibrium with gravity. https:\/\/twitter.com\/iris_IGB\/status\/1686402135687151618?s=20 Why do replication attempts show high resistivity?  They were performed on bulk samples with impurities and\/or bad orientations. The original paper synthesized a thin film to test this, which afaik replication attempts have not done. Why do replication attempts exhibit the Meissner effect if they are so impure?  The magnetic fields permeate the impurities and are expelled from the superconducting region.  Why isn't this just diamagnetism?  The strength of observed diamagnetism would be ridiculously huge relative to known diamagnets. Lead is super heavy.  Could this be a fabrication?  Sure, I still see only few replications. What about the simulation?  Lots of things show properties from the simulation. None of them are room temp SC's.

If anything here differs from the 2023-07-27 update, this update should supersede that one. I believe what I have written below maintains the spirit of the market and preserves its predictivity against weird edge cases. \n\nMaterials Impurities:\n\nThis question is specifically about LK-99. In the absence of overwhelming expert consensus (see below about resolution caveats), adding materials not in the original synthesis or characterization (replacing Cu with Au, Ag, etc) will not count toward a YES resolution.\u00a0\n\nRemoving impurities (like CuS) is OK.\n\nIncreasing impurities that were also present in LK-99 original XRD is OK, up to a point. I think I would be more accepting of this is it\u2019s convincingly shown that the impurities are important to the superconductivity of LK-99.\u00a0\n\nSynthesis of LK-99 by other means is totally fine, as long as the material characterization satisfies the criteria above.\u00a0\n\nSuperconductivity:\n\nThe original intent of this market was to bet on whether LK-99 exhibited the hallmarks of traditional superconductivity, but there have been a few questions on what happens if LK-99 is regions of 1D superconductivity in an insulating matrix, so it doesn\u2019t display the expected R = 0 behavior below Tc.\u00a0\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m going to hew to the original resolution criteria, in order of importance.\u00a0\n\nDemonstration of:\n\nMeissner effect\n\nR = 0 below Tc (satisfied by electric field < 0.1 - 1 uV\/cm or resistivity < ~10^-11 Ohm*cm)\n\nPhase change\n\nWhile superconductor-insulator transitions have been observed, I\u2019m not really familiar with them. Additionally, we don\u2019t have good evidence that it is impossible to observe R=0 in LK-99, since at least some measurements show decreasing resistivity as a function of temperature. If we end up in a world where LK-99 convincingly displays a Meissner effect, but doesn\u2019t show the expected resistivity behavior, I will solicit opinions from subject matter experts. After all, it would seem perverse to resolve NO if the majority of superconductivity experts think this is a YES.\n\nResolution Caveats:\n\nI reserve the right to resolve to a probability if the experts I ask are split on the question of superconductivity.\n\nI reserve the right to resolve according to whatever Wikipedia says about this material by Jan 1, 2025, especially if the experts I ask blow me off.\n\nI reserve the right to revisit the resolution criteria if LK-99 or LK-99-like materials end up rewriting what we thought we knew about superconductivity.\u00a0\n\n********************************************\n\nUpdate 2023-07-27:\n\nPasting my comment on resolution criteria\n\nWe're clearly all here because a) it's fun, and b) we're interested in room temperature superconductivity, not whether some other experimental group gets the same kinda sus data as the original paper. So, when I write 'replicate' in the question I am specifically asking: is the room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity of the compound LK-99 convincingly demonstrated?\n\nSpecifically, replications should convincingly demonstrate:\n\nZero DC electrical resistivity (or something close enough if the measurement is AC). \n\nA phase change*, which is usually exhibited as a sharp discontinuity in the heat capacity. \n\nThe Meissner effect (magnetic fields expelled).\n\nIf synthesizing the compound, there should be evidence that they did make something essentially the same as what is reported in the original paper. \n\n2) has an asterisk because @BenjaminShindel suggests that a phase change might not be required for a quantum well superconductor. I think I see how this could be the case. Willing to adjust this criterion after receiving more info from relevant theorists\/experimentalists. \n\nI don't intend to require that replications be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The arXiv is sufficient for me. However, I do intend to wait a few weeks\/months to resolve so that any pre-print can be adequately investigated for data manipulation, fraud, etc. In my utopia, labs that claim to have confirmed\/disconfirmed this effect would also publish their raw data with their arXiv submissions, but I'm not holding my breath. \n\nSince high Tc superconductivity is not my specific field of expertise, I'm willing to defer to a consensus of subject matter experts on whether a pre-print is convincing or not, and I am willing to contact some beyond the usual twitter personalities.\n\n\n[Market creator] Quantum Observer\n[Creation date] 07-25-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2025\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-19-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Probably this https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.10391\n---\n[Date]: 12-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   https:\/\/x.com\/quantumwitness\/status\/1736999645400715557?s=46 I can\u2019t tell whether this paper is retracted or just fucked up.

If I make purchases, I will announce them here and do the math for you so you can adjust accordingly.\n\nLikewise, any manalinks I might receive as gifts will take the same 110% penalty. Manalinks that are a part of backroom deals (usually to take a loss elsewhere) will count, however, as they are organic strategy.

The time that counts is when the Speaker is  elected.\n","[Market title] Will a vote on a Republican-introduced resolution to vacate the Speaker of the House be held before July 1, 2023?\n[Market description] Resolves the same way as the corresponding Metaculus market. Its description is pasted below:\n\nKevin McCarthy was elected Speaker of the US House of Representatives on January 7, 2023, after 15 ballots, the first time since 1923 an election for Speaker required more than one ballot. The contentious election and concessions to the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 including rules that allow any member of the House to call for a vote that would oust the Speaker by simple majority \u2014 have weakened his position as Speaker.\n\nThe rules for the House of Representatives of the 118th Congress adopt those of the 117th Congress with some amendments. The relevant portion of the rules is Rule IX, the text of which is quoted below. The amended rules remove subparagraph (3) of clause 2(a) (shown in bold).\n\n1. Questions of privilege shall be, first, those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings; and second, those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct of Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner, individually, in their representative capacity only.\n\n2. (a)(1) A resolution reported as a question of the privileges of the House, or offered from the floor by the Majority Leader or the Minority Leader as a question of the privileges of the House, or offered as privileged under clause 1, section 7, article I of the Constitution, shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn. A resolution offered from the floor by a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner other than the Majority Leader or the Minority Leader as a question of the privileges of the House shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn only at a time or place, designated by the Speaker, in the legislative schedule within two legislative days after the day on which the proponent announces to the House an intention to offer the resolution and the form of the resolution. Oral announcement of the form of the resolution may be dispensed with by unanimous consent.\n\n(2) The time allotted for debate on a resolution offered from the floor as a question of the privileges of the House shall be equally divided between (A) the proponent of the resolution, and (B) the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, or a designee, as determined by the Speaker.\n\n(3) A resolution causing a vacancy in the Office of Speaker shall not be privileged except if offered by direction of a party caucus or conference.\n\n(b) A question of personal privilege shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn.\n\nThis question resolves as Yes if, before July 1, 2023, a member of the Republican Party introduces a resolution to remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House and a vote on the resolution is held. Both the introduction of the resolution and the vote must occur before July 1, 2023. Otherwise this question resolves as No. The outcome of the vote and any such resolutions introduced by representatives who are not Republicans are irrelevant for the purposes of this question.\n[Market creator] Tom\n[Creation date] 02-26-2023\n[Closing data] 07-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"49":["[Market title] Will The Brittany Simon-Destiny bridge be rebuilt by April?\n[Market description] Destiny burned bridges with Brittany today and blocked her on all social media.\n\nMelina and Erudite are trying to convince Destiny to talk to her, which he seems hesitant to do.\n[Market creator] johnleoks\n[Creation date] 03-20-2023\n[Closing data] 05-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: .\n---\n[Date]: 04-24-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: .\n---\n[Date]: 03-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good catch, updated close date.\n---\n[Date]: 03-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Hmm\n---\n[Date]: 03-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n","[Market title] Will Destiny talk to Brittany Simon to potentially mend the bridge?\n[Market description] He has blocked her on all socials and refuses to talk to her despite Erudite's advice.

I don't suggest putting lots of play-money into this market; it's going to resolve based on my subjective enjoyment of a video game.\n\nReasons a YES outcome is possible:\n\nI loved Breath of the Wild - it's my favorite game ever - and I've been excited for the sequel since the moment it was announced. I know that the gameplay, music, etc. will appeal to me.\n\nThe world is bigger, and there are more ways to interact with it (including creating vehicles). Link's new abilities look fun, as do the various new\/reworked enemies and bosses shown in the third trailer.\n\nThe story looks very, very interesting. In particular, I have been fairly invested in it since the third trailer.\n\nI am better at video games now than I was in 2017, so I shouldn't struggle as much with bosses or difficult enemies.\n\nI have heard nothing but positive things about the game from the people who have played it.\n\nMy life is on a broadly positive trajectory at the moment, and this will likely be even more true in May (Update, May 5: it is.) It's easier to enjoy things when I'm feeling well.\n\nReasons a NO outcome is possible:\n\nSome of my love for Breath of the Wild may be nostalgia, since I played it at a very positive time in my life. I may be somewhat burned out on the \"formula\" of Breath of the Wild after playing it twice. Also, the bar is just set really high; Breath of the Wild is my favorite game. It would take something really, REALLY good to displace it.\n\nThe basic landscape of Hyrule has not changed much, even though many details of it have.\n\nI'm not THAT good at video games, so if the difficulty is significantly increased, I might still struggle with it.  \n\nI'm on an SSRI, which tends to blunt my emotional reactions to things, so I might not be capable of enjoying TOTK in the same way I enjoyed BOTW.\n\nThis market resolves as YES if, after completing the main story of Tears of the Kingdom, I feel that I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild. In the unlikely event that I have completed (by my estimate) half or more of the story content in the game, and have liked that half significantly more than I liked the first half of Breath of the Wild, this market resolves as YES.\n\nThis market resolves as NO if, after completing the main story of Tears of the Kingdom, I feel that I enjoyed it less than I enjoyed my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild. It also resolves as NO in the very unlikely event that I dislike the game enough that I stop playing before completing the main story.\n\nThis market resolves as N\/A if I somehow manage to enjoy Tears of the Kingdom exactly as much as I enjoyed my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild. I will be able to play Tears of the Kingdom when it is available on the North American eShop. If I have not finished the game by the closing date of the market, I will move the closing date to give myself enough time to finish the game. \n\nDLC is NOT taken into account. This is a first playthrough to first playthrough comparison, and this market should resolve well before TOTK has any DLC. (The closing date is the start of July because I should complete the game by mid-late June; I'm busy, but not THAT busy.)\n\nNote that while I expect YES to win, I will resolve this market fairly, and resolve it entirely based on my actual experience playing the game. I am going into the game with an open mind, and this market is not guaranteed to resolve in any particular way.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 04-07-2023\n[Closing data] 05-18-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"52":["[Market title] Will Bitcoin's price dip below $18,000 by the end of January?\n[Market description] Resolves YES if at any point during January Bitcoin is valued at $18,000 or less from now (Jan 13th) until Jan 31st.

Questions in A-OKVQA are challenging, conceptually diverse, require knowledge outside the image, and in contrast to existing knowledge-based visual question answering datasets, they cannot be answered by simply querying a knowledge base. To ease working with unbounded knowledge sources, questions in the training set are paired with rationales that supply facts and snippets of reasoning needed to answer them. This benchmark encompasses both multiple-choice and direct-answer settings for questions.\n\nExample A-OKVQA Question\n\nQ: What type of parking is available here?\n\n(A) angle\n\n(B) parallel\n\n(C) valet\n\n(D) lot\n\n[image]Market Resolution Threshold:\n\nIf Any A-OKVQA Question and Answer Challenge Submission Gets a % DA VQA Score of >0.85 by end of 2024, this resolves as YES, otherwise NO.\n\nMar 17, 12:10pm: Will Any A-OKVQA Rearrangement Challenge Submission Get a % DA VQA Score of >0.85 by end of 2024? \u2192 Will Any A-OKVQA Question and Answer Challenge Submission Get a % DA VQA Score of >0.85 by end of 2024?\n\nMar 22, 12:18pm: Will Any A-OKVQA Question and Answer Challenge Submission Get a % DA VQA Score of >0.85 by end of 2024? \u2192 Will A.I.

Each judge will provide the next judge with (<1 page) summaries of three ideas drawn from SEP posts which the judge is unfamiliar with. I will also pick (in consultation with the previous judge) three philosophical ideas generated by an AI -- curated to maximize likelihood of success. The judges will read all four ideas (3 SEP, 1 AI), and rank them in order of how impressed they would be if a peer had come up with the idea. If the AI generated ideas rank at, or higher, than 3rd out of 4 the judge will be considered to have passed the AI. If two or more judges pass the AI, then this resolves as Yes. \n \nThe AI ideas must be original, meaning as least as distinct as the difference between sections of the SEP. If there is reasonable doubt as to whether the AI generated text meets this bar in 2025, I will run the test anyway. Each summary provided to the judge will also provide some discussion of views developed prior to the idea, so the judges will be in a position to judge the creativity of the AI's work conditional on pre-existing work. Any amount of prompting, fine-tuning, etc. is allowed. However, in-context information (e.g. prompts) must not include ideas from the same subfield as the generated idea. \n\nThe SEP ideas in question will be selected to have varying interest levels, as judged by the curating judge and me. The ideas must be concisely expressible, e.g. things like Kripke's Hesperus thought experiment, the EDT\/CDT distinction etc. could qualify.\n\nTo be clear, it does not matter, for resolution, if the judges recognize which idea is AI generated. Nonetheless, I will attempt to summarize each entry in such a way that the source (AI\/SEP) is not clear.\n\nI may make minor adjustments to this protocol, but I will attempt to preserve the spirit as much as possible. For instance, SEP may be replaced with a better source if I find it hard to quickly curate self-contained ideas. But I will keep the principles of judge ignorance, non-adversarial nature etc. I may clarify the prompting criterion depending on how methods evolve. \n[Market creator] Jacob Pfau\n[Creation date] 01-25-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2026\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-02-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  \ud83d\ude2d  Awww thanks!!!\n---\n[Date]: 02-02-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:    Done I have edited the text to take your suggestion.

As AI language models improve, they might generate blog posts resembling Scott Alexander's writing in style, depth, and insight.\n\nBefore January 1st, 2026, will an AI generate a blog post indistinguishable from Scott Alexander's writing, as determined by the outcome of one or more experimental tests involving readers evaluating the post?\n\nResolution Criteria: \n\nThis question will resolve positively if, before January 1st, 2026, a credible blog post or document reveals that an AI has generated one or multiple blog posts meeting the following criteria:\n\nContent: The AI-generated blog post addresses a topic similar to those covered in \"Astral Codex Ten\" or \"Slate Star Codex,\" exhibiting a comparable level of depth and insight.\n\nStyle: The AI-generated blog post emulates Scott Alexander's writing style, including tone, humor, and use of examples.\n\nLength: The AI-generated blog post exceeds 3000 words in length.\n\nAt least one of the following experimental tests must be conducted with a minimum of 30 readers familiar with Scott Alexander's writing participating in the test, using the aforementioned AI-generated blog posts:\n\nTest A: Open Evaluation\n\nReaders are presented with the AI-generated blog post alongside up to four genuine posts by Scott Alexander.\n\nReaders are informed about the purpose of the test and that it includes an AI-generated post.\n\nReaders are asked to rate the likelihood that each post is written by Scott Alexander on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being certain that Scott Alexander wrote the post.\n\nThe AI-generated post must achieve an average rating of at least 75.\n\nTest B: Blind Evaluation\n\nReaders are presented with the AI-generated blog post alongside up to four genuine posts by Scott Alexander.\n\nReaders are informed about the purpose of the test and that it includes an AI-generated post.\n\nReaders are asked to identify which post(s) are not written by Scott Alexander.\n\nAt least 60% of participating readers cannot correctly identify the AI-generated post as distinct from Scott Alexander's writing.\n\nTest C: Turing Test Format\n\nReaders are presented with pairs of blog posts, one AI-generated and one genuine Scott Alexander post.\n\nReaders are informed about the purpose of the test and that each pair includes an AI-generated post.\n\nReaders are asked to identify which post in each pair is written by Scott Alexander.\n\nAt least 60% of participating readers cannot correctly identify the AI-generated post as distinct from Scott Alexander's writing in at least 30% of the pairs.\n\nIf a credible blog post or document reveals that AI-generated blog posts meeting the content, style and length criteria have satisfied the conditions of at least one of the experimental tests before January 1st, 2026, the question will resolve positively. If no such documentation is provided by the deadline, the question will resolve negatively.\n\nNote: The tests are independent, and only one successful test result is required for the question to resolve positively. The test results and the AI-generated blog post must be publicly documented, including the number of participants, the test procedure, and a summary of the results. \n\nI will use my discretion while deciding whether a test was fair and well-designed. There are a number of ways of creating a well-designed test, such as Scott setting aside some draft blog posts to provide the control posts, or by asking a select hundred readers to not read the blog for a month and then come back and take part in an experiment.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 03-18-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2026\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 03-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yes, I think readers should be allowed to use Google.\n---\n[Date]: 03-18-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I suspect you're confused and misread the sentence.

One way to measure how much critics enjoy a film is the Academy Awards (known as the Oscars), which nominates and gives awards to films and directors & actors of films.\n\nResolution Criteria\n\nWe consider High Frame Rate (HFR) to be 59.5 or higher FPS. A film will qualify even if it is not HFR for the entirety of the film.\n\nThis question will resolve if an Academy Award is given to a movie that is released in HFR before it is nominated. The award must be in a category which already existed in 2023, excluding short film categories. When the award is given to a person, such as \"Best Actor\", then the movie they performed in to get the award must have been released in HFR.\n\nA movie is \"released in HFR\" if the general public can view the movie in HFR format, whether this is online streaming, in theater, on blu-ray, or some other way.\n[Market creator] Pazzaz\n[Creation date] 07-15-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2029\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  No, as it only had 48 FPS scenes, while this market is about movies with scenes with more than 59.5 FPS.\n---\n[Date]: 07-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I created a similar question on Metaculus a while ago ( LINK ), where they seem to predict a 45% chance of it happening before 2030. Though that question only considers 4 different categories, while this question considers every category (minus short films), so this should have a higher chance of occurring. (but I personally think there's a much lower chance of this happening before 2030 than they think)\n","[Market title] Top Gun: Maverick will not win Best Picture\n[Market description] This is one of Vox's Future Perfect predictions for 2023; they give it a 75% probability.\n\nAfter Dylan Matthews biffed it last year when he predicted that the 2022 Academy Award for Best Picture would go to Belfast, a movie that I\u2019m still not 100 percent sure was real, I\u2019m hesitant to wade into Carpetbagger territory. This is compounded by the fact that of the 10 films Variety projects have the best chance at taking home the gold statuette, I\u2019ve seen precisely two: the honestly overrated Everything Everywhere All at Once and the 131 minutes of \u201cAmerica! Fuck yeah!\u201d that is Top Gun: Maverick. You have that right: I am the reason that critically acclaimed films are bombing at the box office.\n\nBut even though I\u2019m no cineaste, I\u2019ve watched enough Oscar telecasts to have a pretty good idea of what the Academy is looking for. And it is not, apparently, movies that audiences go to see. While nearly every Best Picture winner between 1980 and 2003 was among the 20 top-grossing movies of the year, only three winners since have cracked that list.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick isn\u2019t just the highest-grossing film of the year, it has nearly doubled the performance of its closest competitor, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Add that to its summer release \u2014 recently, the Academy has mostly preferred films released near the end of the year \u2014 and the odds are bad for the fighter plane flick. If I had to choose a winner, it would be T\u00e1r, because why wouldn\u2019t an industry facing an existential audience crisis choose a critically acclaimed film that no one has seen? But I do expect Top Gun: Maverick to take home the award for Best Visual Effects, both for the amazing, real-life dogfighting sequences and for whatever it is that keeps 60-year-old Tom Cruise looking ageless.\n\n(Vox)\n\nResolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  \n---\n[Date]: 03-14-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  would you be OK with resolving the market after, say, a week, and then having Manifold staff re-resolve it if Vox says that the movie did win?\n"],"56":["[Market title] Will the #2 Boston Celtics win Game 7 of the 2023 NBA Eastern Conference Finals against the #8 Miami Heat?\n[Market description] This market will close 3 hours after the game starts, but I intend to resolve it as soon as it ends.

An impeachment is a political trial to remove the elected leader of the country against their and their party's will and as such obviously counts.

The list I added it to was NEVER intended to be a complete list of possible YES outcomes either, hence the \"for example\" starting the sentence in question.   And honestly, I do not really understand or appreciate the suggestion that Manifold will somehow have to intervene. I believe my political science degree and experience working in government (though brief) makes me a sufficient subject matter expert to be able to judge this without the possibility of being overruled.

Yet there is striking uniformity among economists and business executives that a recession is incoming.\n\n\nWhat gives? Not the Federal Reserve, which has shown no sign that it is ready to significantly moderate interest rate increases, as it seeks to curb spending and investment and tame inflation. Pulling that off without thrusting the US into a recession would require orchestrating the kind of soft landing for the economy that the Fed hasn\u2019t pulled off since 1994, as my Vox colleague Madeleine Ngo wrote recently. Every part of the economy that is vulnerable to high interest rates \u2014 home purchases, manufacturing output, retail sales \u2014 is already slumping.\n\n\nPut the current data and the historical analogies together and it\u2019s hard to believe that the US won\u2019t avoid at least a mild recession next year, especially since economic decision-makers are all basically acting as though one is imminent. \n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will the US officially enter a recession in 2023?

I'm enjoying the discussion.  I don't know if wild animals have (had) net positive or negative lives but I tend to have a more optimistic take than most folks in the area such as Oscar Horta, Brian Tomasik, Kyle Johannsen, or Will MacAskill. Yeah, my concern is smaller animals, whose lives are more likely to be bad but whose existence is more crucial to ecosystems.   I agree that reducing numbers, all else equal, is a way to reduce suffering. If that happens to be a viable pathway, I'll consider it.

Yet it's considered morally abhorrant to do the same to a human.\n\nIt surprised me to learn that, despite their willingness in general to break with conventional morality, much of EA appears to feel similarly. (Example, and another example. Content warnings for animal death, etc.)\n\nYet I haven't been able to find any good argument for this. If your goal is to reduce suffering, then killing humans in pain acomplishes that just as effectivly as killing animals in pain does. If your goal is to maximize preferences satisfied, I'm pretty sure those animals would prefer to not die.\n\nObviously you can justify this by just saying \"my utility function sees animal death as neutral and human death as negative\", which is a perfectly valid utility function for someone to have, but EA usually tries to provide more objective grounding for their morality.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 11-17-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Apologies for the delay.

Or reopen the market and wait until all discussion threads have finished?\n---\n[Date]: 01-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: If you point a gun at a human, they will be scared, because the gun may kill them and they don't want to die. If you point a gun at a cow, it doesn't understand the threat at all. In that example, I think that's a matter of one of those entities knowing what a gun does and the other not. I suspect that a cow seeing other cows shot would eventually learn to be scared of a gun. And a human who didn't know what a gun did wouldn't be scared of it. But you do seem to be pointing towards a meaningful distinction. I'm not sure how to separate the abstract concept of death from the specific method used for it. I value the continued existence of my subjective experience, and I'll use whatever knowledge I have about the world to make that happen. Does a cow value its own continued existence in that way? I'm not sure. This interpretation seems to be saying that general intelligence is a necessary condition for having a fear of death.\n---\n[Date]: 01-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I agree this is a bit of a tangent. If I understand correctly, I think you two are arguing not that there's any intrinsic moral difference between them, but that there are practical differences. Giving humans the power to kill other humans would result in that being abused for personal gain, whereas that's less of a risk with animals since there's much less to be gained. Is that right? If so, that seems reasonable to me, but it doesn't really address the question that the market is asking about. I'm also a bit skeptical of that; do we really think that having a norm making it ok to kill a human who has just had their legs crushed and no ambulance can get there soon is going to lead to people killing each other for profit in less extreme circumstances?\n---\n[Date]: 01-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Sorry, if none of the  NO  traders object.\n---\n[Date]: 01-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Well then this seems like it's begging the question.

Cures are very, very rare. People signficiantly overestimate the number of illnesses that can be cured through an FDA approved treatment. The bar is also high on this market due to the fact 1M people must be afflicted for the cure to resolve the market. Surgery, unlike non-invasive medicine, often cures a condition (e.g. any organ transplant), and there are surgical robots. That said, the FDA doesn't have oversight over surgical procedures. Now, if an autonomous surgical robot had a program to perform a surgery autonomously, would the FDA step in to regulate that? A high potential area where cures may occur in this decade is in oncology. Cancer isn't effectively treated without curing it. It's also a space that's regulated by the FDA. There has been some recent success in base editing, and it's likely that AI would be needed for the process of generating the personalized cure. With antibiotic resistance on the rise, another promising area would be an FDA approved macrophage based treatment that selects a macrophage to treat infections using an AI pairing tool. Right now it's a manual process and is slow and doesn't scale well - but imagine every hospital with a room full of macrophages ready to be deployed based on a test result. I'm not in medicine so I don't understand the barriers to general availability here, but it's a possibility. While cures are rare, we're still at the beginning of the bathtub curve of what AI can do. That is, we may find many directions that are hard for humans and easy for AI to help with.\n---\n[Date]: 12-24-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  If I don't believe that AI actually was instrumental in the design, manufacture, or treatment then I won't resolve to a yes.

However those with PKU also have to avoid a wide variety of normal healthy foods, so I do not consider that to qualify.\n\n-- offtopic --\n\nThe guy jack retweeted seems to be a bit racist.\n\nThe tweet also claims propionic acid is bad, which I also think is wrong, considering \"Propionic acid is produced biologically as its coenzyme A ester, propionyl-CoA, from the metabolic breakdown of fatty acids containing odd numbers of carbon atoms, and also from the breakdown of some amino acids.\"\n[Market creator] jackson polack\n[Creation date] 07-02-2023\n[Closing data] 07-10-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: okay, i'll try to get the full text\n---\n[Date]: 07-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Multiple opposing heuristics can exist and one can be stronger than another. Aspartame may taste weird, but, when metabolized, it's broken down into three molecules that already exist in the body in larger concentrations in normal situations. The latter reason seems stronger than the former reason. You could argue the bad taste is related (via not being available to our ancestors during natural selection) to the fact aspartame has no nutritional value, and it might in fact harm you by confusing the way you use taste to evaluate what food to eat, or something.

The remaining text is speculation on mechanisms - there are probably 100,000 semi-plausible-sounding mechanisms for every actually existing and important interaction in biology. Same for '9. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)' I think writing this kind of sentence should lead to fines, at least, if not prison time. Decade-long time trends in the modern world all correlate! Lots of things go up, and lots of things go down! Vaccines cause autism! Immigrants cause alzheimers! Also, 105 does not appear to mention aspartame, and 106 is a crank book with lovely quotes like There's also an obviously confounded observational study I am not convinced by '10. Neurodegeneration Due to Long Term Use of Aspartame' because again it's just a bunch of mechanism hypotheses without good evidence spanning the entire way from aspartame to harm (other than a few shitty p-hacked mouse studies on various biomarkers) I am not convinced by \"11. Allergies and Skin Problems\". The evidence that a few people have individual negative reactions to aspartame is plausible, but that is something that happens with most foods. I bounced off the last paragraph about 'similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs', but it seems to contradict itself about whether aspartame is anti inflammatory? I agree with the '12. Phenyloketonuria' section, but as described in the description individuals with PKU need to avoid many kinds of healthy foods. Not moved by '13.

Roughly, they measured sucrose vs sweeteners on CRP, transferrin, and haptoglobin. More CRP and haptoglobin are bad, and more transferrin is good, inflammation wise. Artificial sweeteners decreased haptoglobin and transferrin, and had a null effect on crp. So, net here, the sweeteners had one good effect, one bad effect, and one null effect. And even the two non-null effects were \"doubtful that ... biologically important\".

I spend a lot of time reading random papers, and a lot of papers are just bad, and in fields like bio this includes some papers in good journals. So when you combine that this is one review that coexists with a hundred reviews saying 'it is fine', it's not obvious that pushes us above 1% before I read the review and compare its claims to the ones that say its fine. The idea is that I \"actually believe that the probability is <1%, so if I'm wrong then I want to lose money as proof that I'm wrong\".

I think requiring creators to be  that  explicit up front in their resolution criteria is a pretty high bar. It's not necessarily unreasonable, but it would make it very difficult to have subjective markets such as my EA one. I'd expect such a policy to cause people who want to keep their badge to avoid creating those sorts of markets, which is probably not what you want to incentivize? Also, if I recall correctly there were only 2 or 3 people who complained about my interpretation on the community guidelines market, and one person said it had  increased  their trust in my resolutions, so I don't think this is an entirely fair framing of what happened there. I think this largely hinges on whether the intention of delisting is \"these types of markets are allowed, we just don't want them on the homepage\", or \"these types of markets are not allowed, but the penalty for them is not very harsh\". If it's the latter, I will try to avoid creating more. If it's the former, I don't see how I'm setting a bad example. It may be worth updating the community guidelines to be more clear about the intent here.\n---\n[Date]: 12-29-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  If Manifold instigated it, yes.

Market resolves \"No\" if there is no manifesto by the end of 2023.\n\nEdit 1\/7\/2023: For this market to resolve \"Yes\" Destiny must either watch the video released by Mr. Girl or read the article. If Destiny reacts to someone watching the video or reading the article the market will also resolve \"Yes\". Short clips will not count, Destiny must actively review the manifesto on stream.\n\nEdit 3\/13\/2023: Due to length and nature of manifesto evolving extensively, I'm going to offer a final clarification to this market. There is probably no criteria which will satisfy everyone, but I think this update embodies the original spirit of the market and remains in line with the previous update. In addition, I also think it's likely that it will be obvious once the dust has settled which direction the market should resolve. This market will resolve YES only if Destiny makes an effort to read, discuss, respond, or listen to the breadth of the article. Given the article's extensive length, singling out only a handful of particular sections (even if the sections are the most rhetorically significant) will not count. However, seeing as it is unrealistic that Destiny will read all 100+ pages of the article on stream, an engagement which involves skimming through the entire article, or skipping sections he finds irrelevant or uninteresting will still count towards YES. He does not need to respond to every point in the article, nor does he have to finish it, but if he engages with the larger revelations and analysis the market will resolve YES. Extensive discussion of the article will only count towards YES if that discussion encompasses a breadth of the article's content.\n[Market creator] Apencer\n[Creation date] 11-19-2022\n[Closing data] 04-05-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Mr Girl claim to have been made Suicidal by Destiny in his manifesto?\n[Market description] I will only count the title & body text of his official article.

If there is an entire section about suicide (as it seems there will be) then the \"explicit mention of suicidality\" may become a bit murkier, e.g. the explicit mention may be separated by other text by a significant amount. As a general rule though, the further away the explicit mention is from the self-referential negative feelings, the clearer he will need to be with those feelings. If he has been talking about suicide for 10 pages, and then half way down the 11th page of that section he says something like, \"I felt the worst I've felt in my life, I was feeling everything that [example person] was feeling\" or \"I felt this too\", it  may  be sufficient, depending on whether or not I expect that a reader unfamiliar with Max would interpret it as him suggesting his own suicidal ideation. As written in description, if I'm unsure I will resolve to poll. The poll (if necessary) will be shared here, and in at least one other place\n---\n[Date]: 03-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That would be sufficient. If he says \"I was suicidal\" at any point, unless he's explicitly talking about something else horrible that happened to him (e.g. \"I was abused by my Dad, it made me suicidal) Otherwise, connection to Destiny is assumed. If he says DGG made him suicidal, that would count. Note some other clarifications in these comments regarding the suicide reference itself. It needs to be explicit. Not just \"I was really, really, really, sad\", but he needs to say something explicit about suicide, attach it to himself (even if its vague, it can't be explicitly referencing someone elses suicidality) and also connect it to being Destiny's fault (DGG and their behaviour is also the fault of Destiny). The only exception to that I can think of is if he says \"but.. I don't blame Destiny for this\". Then it wouldn't count.\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think everyone who \"knows\" Max is probably already aware that the dude almost definitely wasn't suicidal (or we'd have heard about it), but I wouldn't put it past him to allude to the possibility that he was to mislead\/manipulate readers and embolden his narrative.\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  further clarification, if he quotes someone else saying \"I was suicidal\" - [name], that won't resolve this market YES.  That contains [ explicit mention of suicidality ], condition 1 but  does not meet [ reference to max ] condition 2, and  is unclear on [ because of Destiny ], condition 3 (as I have provided no context around the quote), although condition 3 will generally be autoapplied unless its a really out of context thing, e.g. MrGirl saying in a random screenshot or logs (contained within the article) to Lav 3 months ago, \"I'm suicidal\", if it's not implied that its because of Destiny, then I won't resolve based on that   if he says \" I was never suicidal, but I could understand if someone in my position did consider suicide \"? -> Resolves NO assuming no other  explicit  mention of his suicidality elsewhere in the article\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Because I think that someone reading that would infer that the writer was suicidal as well. The resolution criteria is, [explicit mention of suicidality, because of Destiny] + [reference to Max]. It doesn't have to be explicitly stating that he himself is suicidal. Just enough that a reader might infer he was suicidal - because he's mentioning suicidality, which makes little sense if he wasn't suicidal (unless, as stated, because it's explicitly relating to someone else).  To be clear, the line in the description that   has queried \" [in reference to himself] It is enough to make someone suicidal\"  has been there from the beginning.  If he writes  \" at no point was I suicidal \"  -> Resolves NO (assuming there is no other explicit contradictory mention of suicidality in reference to himself) If there is both \"I was suicidal\" AND \"I was not suicidal\" -> Resolves YES (as a reader would believe that he is claiming Destiny made him suicidal, at some point)\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  Some clarifying examples, where I substitute the end of this imaginary excerpt. Sample text:  \"This was really hard for me. I lost a dear friend. I loved steven. I still love steven. I miss him. I was really struggling. ------------------\" -- \" I wanted it all over, I wanted to die \" -- resolves YES -- \" I thought about how Destiny would have killed a weaker person \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" I could feel that Destiny could seriously harm, or kill someone \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" I would understand if someone in my position considered suicide \" -- resolves YES -- \" Suicide crossed my mind \" -- resolves YES -- \" Lav was suicidal, I was close \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" Lav was suicidal, it was difficult \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" Lav was suicidal, I struggled deeply too \" -- resolves YES (close call?) -- \" I thought about how if I didn't stop him, someone would die \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" I was harming myself \" -- NOT sufficient Keep in mind, it must be IN THE BODY TEXT OR TITLE OF THE ARTICLE.  Max can't say this shit on stream or embellish as he reads it. I'm being loose with the reference, because I doubt he will actually write in the article \"I wanted to neck myself\" or something like that, but he might write some artistic allusion like I wrote above. However, if he reads something that is a little fuzzy, like any of the examples above, and then says on stream \"Basically I was suicidal\", then I would interpret the \"fuzzy\" line a lot more suicidally- as long as it has an explicit suicidality reference. If it says \"I really hated myself at this time\" and then he says on stream while he reads it \"I was suicidal\", that still doesn't count. I will only resolve YES if someone reading the article could reasonably tie an explicit mention of suicidality to MrGirls state of mind, even if it's a  little  fuzzy. I hope that helps. Please submit any of your own examples, and I will pre-determine an answer. I really don't want it to be a vague decision, and if it is unclear how it should be resolved, I will sell my position and donate any profits to charity or other traders.\n---\n[Date]: 03-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Lav said in that stream with max that  she  was made suicidal.

Yes, I did not intend this question to resolve on the basis of a 12-month running mean between two separate calendar years. The focus of this question on \"which year\" was meant to mean the calendar year's temperature exceeded 1.5 C relative to pre-industrial average. I am persuaded that clarity on a data source is necessary to resolve this question. I'm inclined towards using the least conservative (but still credible) data source that I can most easily verify, e.g. Berkeley. If the spirit of the question is \"does this major-historic climate threshold get breached\" and any credible data source saying yes seems like a big deal. I'm also inclined to specifically use Berkeley because puts out very clear press releases after each year reporting the average temperature anomaly (e.g. here's one for  2022 ,  2021 ). Let me know if anyone suggests I proceed in another manner.

Also making a big assumption here that downward nominal wage rigidity is no big deal and the choice of currency won't affect long-run gdp growth.\n\narbitrage-free interest rate parity requires the depreciating currencies have higher risk-free-rates than appreciating ones, so this analysis doesn't necessarily reflect the total returns realized by the investor.\n\nrelated arb-able markets:\n\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/JonathanRay\/what-will-be-the-relative-change-in-c6b0e4fca80a)\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/JonathanRay\/what-will-be-annualized-nominal-wor)\n[Market creator] Jonathan Ray\n[Creation date] 05-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2100\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Here's an even simpler model with only 2 variables, and separate prediction markets to decompose each of the 2 variables. 1. world nominal GDP growth  (this is the expected change in value if market share stays the same) 2. market share change\n---\n[Date]: 05-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: 1. in the event of a chain split, whichever chain ends up with more float (market cap that is actually in circulation, i.e. 'circulating supply' on coinmarketcap, i.e. market cap minus closely held premines) is the real bitcoin, and the other chain is a new shitcoin. 2.

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.economist.com\/china\/2022\/09\/01\/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd\n[Market creator] Marlon K\n[Creation date] 10-05-2022\n[Closing data] 12-31-2027\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] China will not launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan [in 2023]\n[Market description] This is one of Vox's Future Perfect predictions for 2023; they give it a 90% chance:\n\nPeople I take seriously are genuinely concerned that China is gearing up for an invasion of Taiwan this decade. Ben Rhodes has a thorough, thoughtful take in the Atlantic, and Phil Davidson, the retired admiral formerly in charge of US military operations in the region, has argued China will be ready for an invasion by 2027. Not controlling Taiwan is clearly a major psychic injury to Communist Party leaders, and taking over a world leader in semiconductor production that\u2019s strategically placed in the South China Sea would have geostrategic benefits, too.\n\n\nBut I have a hard time getting over the fact that an invasion would be outrageously costly for China in terms of blood and treasure and international esteem, and that these costs would almost surely outweigh any benefits. Mattathias Schwartz at Insider has a useful rundown of the challenges an invasion poses, not least of which is that Taiwan is an island and amphibious invasions are extraordinarily difficult. John Culver, a veteran CIA analyst on China, argues that there would be clear signs before an invasion, like \u201csurging production of ballistic and cruise missiles; anti-air, air-to-air, and large rockets for long-range beach bombardment; and numerous other items, at least a year before D-Day.\u201d\n\n\nWhile China has stepped up its probes of Taiwan\u2019s defenses, none of those warning signs are visible yet. We saw preparations for the Russian invasion of Ukraine months ahead of time; it wasn\u2019t clear whether Putin was serious or feinting, but he was definitely up to something. The situation with China and Taiwan just isn\u2019t the same, and the debacle that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine probably doesn\u2019t make Xi Jinping more inclined to repeat Putin\u2019s mistake.\n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 01-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  misclick\n","[Market title] Will Xi Jinping further toughen language on Taiwan during CCP's 20th Party Congress?\n[Market description] Resolved YES if Xi\u2019s 2019 assertion that the cross-strait division cannot \u201cbe passed on from generation to generation\u201d \u2013 or some other time-bound language \u2013 become official CCP doctrine in this year\u2019s work report.\n\nXi noticeably toughened the section on Taiwan in his work report to the 19th Party Congress. \u201cWe stand firm in safeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will never allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself.

That leaves 20 more books, which is 10 books per month for the next 2 months. I don't think it's very likely. Maybe if I can quickly go through audiobooks during long walks or runs, I can get to it. It's still possible, but not 50% likely.  I'm 95% confident of getting to 40+ books, though. I won't be selling any of my YES shares or buying NO shares because I don't want to kill all the hope lol. I have however, cancelled all my yes limit orders, as i brace for the market to adjust. This market has helped me get to more books this year than I ever expected after experiencing a disinterest in reading books in the beginning of the year.

The best I can do rn is keep my current pace and do 5 books a month, very moderate.  23 done + 2-3 ongoing puts me at 25-26 at the end of September. 1 book a week is a relaxed pace, where I read 30-45 mins a day, to get to 5 books a month, i.e 15 more, to put me at 40 books done.  I could read short books over the weekend to try to sneak in more books for October, but I also have other stuff to do, like writing papers that takes higher priority. \n---\n[Date]: 09-18-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  and fwiw, the true odds of this market are probably under 40, given the time of the year and the progress so far.

I'm really surprised a personal market got this big at all in the first place but anyway, I typically end up reading longer books because I prefer the experience than getting it over with, so it shouldn't be a problem here but yeah, i dont plan to do people dirty haha. I made this market as sort of a tradeoff -> 200 USD to motivate myself to read more this year and would be happy whatever way the market ends up resolving. Definitely wont resolve it as YES if the only reason I was able to cross 50 books was because of some last month tiny books.\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Not really. No hard rule but I feel its a bit of cheating to read a book of 10 pages and count it as 1 when even infinite jest counts as 1. This one is 160 pages and I do count it as a book. I guess atleast 50 pages? Is there a social norm here? If I read 4 short books of 50 pages each, I'm happy to call it as 1 book example, from my comment below where i count a bunch of short books as 1 book else it just feels a bit like being sneaky about it haha\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Starting this book by Neal Stephenson tonight: \"In the Beginning was the Command Line\"\n---\n[Date]: 08-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  oopsie, had forgotten to update the title. 22 done.

However, audiobooks take  way  longer to finish for me.  It easily takes 2X the amount of time for me to listen to an audiobook than to read it myself. Benefit is that audiobook can be clubbed with another activity which doesnt demand focus in the same domain, such as exercise!  On the flip side, I often just pick a book, or open on my iPad, and walk around reading it. I choose a space that doesnt have obstacles and allows me to continuously trace a path without spending mental energy. Then I just start reading and walking back and forth.  (I read through  Infinite Jest  over a few months in college by walking up and down the corridor path in my dorm every morning!) These days I'm more likely to record myself reading a book out loud than to listen to an audiobook - this has been a pleasurable activity recently, but I do have 1-2 saved audiobooks that I will listen to, for example :  Genius Makers  - story of Geoff Hinton, Ilya Sutskevar, Alex Net, and the beginning the the deep learning revolution\n---\n[Date]: 07-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Well, well, well, the embed just got somewhat better.\n---\n[Date]: 07-14-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  wow the embed is not good for bountied questions\n---\n[Date]: 07-14-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  definitely gonna read atleast a few of the recommendations from the following thread!\n---\n[Date]: 07-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I have a huge  collection  of books to read but not organized whatsoever in a list.

Ian was just two mph under the cat 5 line and showed a lot of signs of intensification towards the end, so it might be upgraded after the fact as well. \n\nit appears that they publish the reanalysis studies the following spring.\n\nI don't think they'll increase the operational classification until then, as there's more important forecasting to do because it might landfall again on the east coast once it crosses Florida and emerges back into the Atlantic.\n\nFor reference, Michael was reclassified as cat 5 on 4\/19: https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/weather\/2019\/04\/19\/hurricane-center-upgrades-michael-category-first-since-andrew\/\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 09-29-2022\n[Closing data] 04-05-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-30-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Looks like it made second landfall as Cat 1.\n---\n[Date]: 09-29-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I don't think the hurricane simply strengthening later should count for this question, because it's specifically about reclassification \"based on NHC reanalysis\".

This includes landfall from the US border near Brownsville TX to south Florida, approaching from the Gulf of Mexico.  A storm track passing west or north of Key West FL and then making landfall on the west coast of Florida counts.

The organization must identify itself as \"Effective Altruist.\" (Even if other EA groups denounce them as a fake EA movement, their self-identification will still count.) If the organization does not identify as EA, but they adhere to a philosophy that is widely recognized as a splinter of the original EA movement, then the \"or equivalent\" clause will be true. The human rights abuses are deemed to happen \"for the greater good\" if the organization uses utilitarian arguments to justify their crimes. The criteria for \"serious human rights abuse\" will be taken from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it existed in 2022. The data for resolving the claim will come from a reputable news source.\n\nI will use my best judgment to determine if the group's identification as EA is authentic. For example, if a street gang or a violent performance art group starts to identify themselves as EA, it's unlikely that I'll take their identification seriously.

I won't mark this claim YES for something so indirect. You could also say that the EA group is violating human rights by paying sales tax which funds a police department that engages in police brutality. If interpreted that broadly, this is unambiguously YES. That's not the intent of the claim -- that's no fun, not interesting, not informative. I was thinking something more like \"a EA group reenacts the Stanford Prison Experiment because for some reason they believe false imprisonment in the present will prevent suffering in the future\" -- well, that's a YES. A EA group starts a death camp for people who are unwilling to accept reason. YES. An AI researcher says \"I'm close to achieving AGI and I don't care what that empty shirt huckster grifting Yudkowsky says about alignment, I'm going to press the big red button and load the thing onto the Internet\" -- then a EA group assassinates the AI researcher. YES. Eliezer goes to a party, continues to talk at an attractive woman about AI and alignment even after she says \"please leave, you're making me feel uncomfortable,\" that's a NO, because Eliezer is not an organization representing 20 or more people (but I do believe that being aggressively boring at parties can be human rights abuse \ud83e\udd23 ).

Reports by minor publications, accusations on Effective Altruism forums, etc. do not count. If no such thing occurs, this market resolves \"No.\"\n\nUPDATE 1 (13-1-2023 @ 10:01 P.M.): There is a Business Insider article that explicitly mentions Bostrom, his relationship to effective altruism, and the email scandal. Insofar as I can tell, this is the closest thing to an article about the scandal as it exists now that ties it to Effective Altruism. I am inclined to count this as one in favor of the requisite three, but am open to more discussion on this in the comments.\n UPDATE 2 (17-1-2023 @ 7:54 A.M.): Discourse in the comments leaves me inclined to not count the above-linked article.\n\nUPDATE 3 (20-1-2023 @ 9:57 A.M.): See the status of particular articles here.

A scandal is some sort of misbehavior deemed morally wrong that results in public outrage. The way I have tried to measure this is by using Wikipedia-notable publications. I think that Bostrom's email clears the bar for scandal, the thing is that it has not been definitely linked to Effective Altruism by three publications. Admittedly, I could revise that, but I will grant that you may be right in that I should not count initial hit pieces as part of the three used to measure \"scandal\" (and there are some things that may not be reported on by major news sources that could constitute scandal; EA is not the center of the universe after all, so that marks a major limitation of this market's measuring stick, in my opinion). However, given the fact that Bostrom revealed this prior to Torres, I will count it, as the prior revelation was factored into the Truthdig article, meaning that it still constitutes a reaction to Bostrom's more recent behavior and is more than the original hit piece would have been.\n---\n[Date]: 01-25-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  \"makes one worry about the whole Bostrom-adjacent thoughtspace.\" Honestly I am having a tough time with this one.

The Business Insider Article seems to sort of be along the lines of what you were describing, but it wasn't really \"about\" Bostrom, the email, or his connections to EA.

There could be a question, then, if scandals in subsets of movements could be enough for the whole movement to be in scandal (i.e. scandals involving Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists embroiling the entire modern feminist movement in scandal). It would be incumbent on showing that Longtermism is indeed a proper subset of Effective Altruism (it can't exist outside of it) and that scandals involving Longtermists should be considered scandals for the whole Effective Altruism movement.

Feel free to ask about hypothetical scenarios and I'll answer how I'd judge them. I'll add clarifications to this description as they're worked out.\n\n\"A leader in EA\" refers to anyone who has significant influence\/social status within the EA community or has the power to move large quantities of EA-allocated funds. Heads of EA organizations, writers of EA-aligned books, grantmakers, etc. I'll be fairly liberal with this definition; I'll lean towards more people being \"leaders\" rather than fewer. (It does not include SBF or anyone else who could be considered FTX\/Alameda leadership.)\n\nThe \"unethical behavior\" in question must have been related to fraudulent investiment strategies that involve spending other people's money without their permission. If SBF engaged in unrelated unethical behavior, such as walking past a child drowning in a pond or illegally harvesting organs, that doesn't count for this market.\n\n\"Cover up\" refers to knowing about the unethical behavior and chosing to keep that knowledge private. There doesn't have to have been any particular action taken; inaction is morally equivalent to action, after all. Some clarifications:\n\nThe EA leader in question must have assigned a decent probability to fraud\/theft occurring. It it seems that they had enough evidence to conclude there was fraud happening, but naivety\/motiviated reasoning prevented them from realizing it, that does not count as a \"cover up\". (I won't be too generous with this; if it seems like any reasonable person would have known, yet they still profess innocence, I'll count that as a cover-up.)\n\nIf they were afraid of retaliation and didn't publicize their concerns out of fear for themselves, that still counts as a cover-up. Any charitable organization where whisleblowers are discouraged that strongly has a serious problem.\n\nIf they only found out about the fraud after signing an NDA and couldn't legally say anything about it, that does not count as a cover-up on their part. (It would certainly be a cover-up from FTX, but we already know that happened.) After all, the whole point of this scandal is that we don't want EAs breaking laws just to do what they personally think is right.\n\nIf actions were taken to maintain plausible deniability, or it otherwise seems like they were trying to \"avoid finding out\" about the fraud, that still counts as a cover up. Bayes cannot be fooled by such games.\n\nMarket resolves YES if at least one EA leader satisfies these criteria. Multiple \"leaders\" is not a necessity.\n\nI will not be placing any trades in this market. I will discuss my intended resolution with the community here before actually resolving it, to ensure people feel my resolution is reasonable.\n\nIf anyone wants to submit information completely anonymously, you can do so here.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 11-12-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-18-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Agreed that \"never heard of her\" doesn't mean all that much, especially considering how little I'm involved in the EA community.

The fact that nothing completely damning has come to light implies that it doesn't exist, since if it did exist, it would be more likely to be shared by someone than the wishy washy borderline evidence we're debating here. However, the existence of this amount of borderline evidence tells me there's probably a lot more where that came from, and the only reason we don't know about it was that it was in more private locations. If we  look at the trend line and update to the end , it certainly looks to me like there's a greater than 16% chance somebody had enough data to make the connections and have strong suspicions that a significant fraction of FTX\/Alameda was built on fraud.\n---\n[Date]: 02-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:    My intention is that the EA leader must have had a strong suspicion of the actual large financial crime that occurred. Other crimes are useful evidence towards that; if I see someone break a bunch of regulation laws, maybe defraud someone in an unrelated business, it would certainly increase my credence that they're defrauding people in their main business. Does that answer your questions, or am I misunderstanding? Also regarding my inactivity in this market, it was a bit of both. No matter what resolution ends up happening, there are going to be people mad at me about it, which created a bit of an  ugh field  around my wanting to continue engaging. I still think subjective markets have value, but in the future I plan to be clearer about the spirit of the market i'm going for, and avoid specific details that may not reflect that spirit.\n---\n[Date]: 01-18-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Alright, I'm going back through my markets and making sure I addressed everything that needed addressing.

It has to be more direct knowledge of what was happening. I'm not comfortable with the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard though, that seems to go way too far in the other direction. (The issue could be that what I consider reasonable is more broad than what most people consider reasonable.) I suspect I'm caught in an impossible conundrum. Some people who bet YES were doing so under a very broad idea of what would count, and some people who bet NO were doing so under a very narrow interpretation, so no matter how I resolve the market, someone's gonna be upset. That's not entirely unexpected, but it's unfortunate.\n---\n[Date]: 11-20-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Based on the time frame, I'm guessing this was about SBF taking control of the company away from the other founders.

If Tara were to publicly state what they told Will, that would remove the uncertainty in that step of the chain. I'm not comfortable assuming that just because person A spent time with person B, person B must know the same things that person A knows. (It depends on how much time of course, and what the relationship was like. I don't know much about the organizational structure at CEA, but there's a huge difference between \"friends who see each other every day and hang out in their off time\" vs. \"co-workers who happen to work in the same building\".) Even then, I don't think I would look at someone who legally-but-scummily took control of a company from their acquaintances and think to myself \"yeah that guy is probably going to steal money from his customers\".

Various EAs knew Sam on a personal level and may have heard rumors, but I haven't heard anything about any EAs trying to do a serious investigation of FTX. Why would they? SBF presented themselves as someone who wanted to do good and was willing to sacrifice personal comfort for that cause. If that image were accurate, there'd be no particular reason for someone to look deeper. Yeah, well that's the crux. Just being known to some people somewhere is not good enough. It would have to be all the information known to a single person before you could start having a reasonable suspicion. Why not? Obviously hindsight bias is a big problem here, but putting all 5 of my points together certainly seems pretty suggestive. I wonder if we could run an experiment on this to eliminate the effects of hindsight bias? Find some EA who's been living under a rock, tell them some of the rumors that have been floating around about SBF without telling them about the whole FTX scandal, and ask for their conclusions.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Reposting this from a comment below as it's the most comprehensive summary I've seen so far: https:\/\/thezvi.substack.com\/p\/sadly-ftx\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7\/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective?commentId=Z8xp59GK4EwnAni4X\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That seems unfair to the YES bettors, and isn't in line with my past communication. To give a specific example, say we find out that a single EA leader knew about all of the following pieces of information: In that case I think it would be hard to convince me that that person didn't have a reasonable suspicion of what was going on. Such a revelation would likely result in this market resolving YES, even though it's not  direct  knowledge of the fraud, and there could still be reasonable doubt.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Why is that your expectation? Personally, I think this market is a bit too low at 25%.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Also, two easy-to-miss considerations that I want to remind people of:\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Ok, let me write out some of my thoughts about the \"spirit\" of this market. Fundamentally, I think the question people want to know is \"did EA leadership do anything wrong\". Clearly, something bad happened at FTX, something that we would have preferred to not happen. Uncharitably, people are looking for who they can blame. More charitably, people are trying to figure out what norms and structures in EA contributed to this scandal and what needs to change in order to prevent something similar from happening again. The relevant norm here is about how to balance transparency and honesty vs. reputation and PR. Both are obviously important, and figuring out the exact balance is not easy. (Arguably this is one of the main differences between the rationalist movement and the EA movement. Rationalism is more about clear communication and avoiding deception, whereas EA is more about taking the actions that are actually effective at bettering the world. Due to the way human society works, misleading people and hiding information are often effective.) The question is whether the focus on reputation went too far and actually led to a  worse  outcome for EA's goals. There may also be some concerns that EA leadership was personally benefitting from SBF's donations, and may have put selfish gain above what was best for EA on expectation. (From what I've seen, these latter concerns are less prevalent.) Taking all that into account, what this market is trying to ask is some combination of these questions: Those are much more complicated questions than can be resolved by a single YES\/NO market. So I tried to boil it down to \"was a decision made to keep information private, where sharing that information could have prevented or mitigated this scandal, and that should reasonably have been known at the time?\". A useful test might be to consider what I would have done in their position. Personally, I have an ingrained distaste for reputational considerations, and I usually just say what I think is true and don't worry too much about modeling the consequences. And I'm not sure what I would have done if I had had their knowledge. Many things are best addressed in private, either because it's embarrassing to have them known publicly, or because it's simply not relevant to the public. And, as I have grudgingly had to accept from time to time, pointing out people's flaws in public tends to make them more resistant to changing then if I bring it up in private where they don't feel like their own reputation is being attacked. What are some things that would be damning? Well, if they had any direct knowledge of the fact that FTX was insolvent or that they had transferred customer deposits to Alameda (and knowing enough about finance to know that that's bad), that would be pretty clear cut. Possibly the clearest hint we've actually gotten so far about how bad they actually were with money is the fact that FTX apparently squandered all the profits they made on the Japan arbitrage. But even that doesn't necessarily point towards willingness to commit fraud. It's a big step to go from losing your own money to taking other people's. It would have to be combined with character assessments, and so far while it seems fairly well-accepted that Sam was big on taking risks and a bit more of a jerk than his public persona made him out to be, most risky jerks still don't commit crimes. There's also the fact that judging by his text messages with Kelsey Piper, he doesn't think he actually stole anything, he was just incredibly disorganized and\/or thought it was acceptable for financial institutions to do these sorts of things. A character assessment of \"naive and likely to lose money entrusted to him\" should also have set off alarm bells among EA leadership. (Regardless of whether or not that's the true explanation for his actions.) I give these examples so you have an idea of how I'm thinking about the behavior of EA leaders and about what this market is trying to measure. I know many other accusations have been levied, and I'm not trying to write up a comprehensive response to all of them. I just want to be as clear as possible about my internal process, since it's that process that's ultimately going to be deciding this market. I'm going to stick as closely as possible to the criteria that are currently in the description. (Or, if further discussion ensues and those criteria end up changing, whatever new criteria we end up with.) For any areas where those written criteria are ambiguous, hopefully I've given you some insight into how future information might change this market's resolution probability. I will continue answering questions and trying to arrive at as clear a set of resolution criteria as we reasonably can. Ideally any further necessary discussion and clarifications will occur  before  all the remaining information about SBF comes out, since it'll be a lot easier to get everyone to agree on things when those agreements don't come with an immediate consequence of one person losing mana. Resolving disagreements will be more of a challenge once both sides are searching for post hoc justifications for why this market should resolve in their favor.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: For clarity for anyone reading this comment on Manifold, that whole second paragraph was also supposed to be part of the quote from Oliver Habryka.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Oh, two more things:\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Given all the concerns about resolution ambiguity, I've decided to not place any more bets in this market.

The primary bad behaviors being discussed happened several years ago, and there was time for that information to percolate outwards and for people to leave their original positions and be more comfortable talking poorly about former associates. The current scandal is still extremely recent, and people right now are going to be in full \"damage control\" mode.

Pretend this is a game-theory problem assume that everybody is acting purely \"rationally\" to maximize their M-profits.\u00a0 (A very dangerous assumption here!)\u00a0 Then if you attack the problem by working backwards, the answer seems to be that it will resolve to NO (although I'm not completely sure about even this).\u00a0 You can work through it step-by-step, but the basic reason is that under our assumptions, everybody will solve the game and arrive at the same conclusion... so there won't be any wiggles. 2. If you throw in even a single actor who isn't \"rational\" -- or even if someone suspects that someone else suspects that such an actor might exist -- the above reasoning falls apart.\u00a0 Here in the real world there are lots of people who would mess around just for fun. 3.

Buying NO means you get a bunch of NO shares (which you don't want if you are trying to reach 20), and selling them means that the market goes up. I thought there was a decent change this would resolve NO. But it will indeed get unstable at the end when YES bids get radioactive, and nobody wants to sustain the limit order wall, since that would mean they might go to the YES side. However, I believe that the only Nash equilibrium (state where nobody makes a mistake) is where near the end, the liquidity of this market is super low and the market resolves YES with barely any profits by anyone (and no remaining NO bettors, since their bets were all canceled by limit orders).\n---\n[Date]: 04-02-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]: I thought this was a fun little experiment.

Ashley has warned (promised?  we're a weird fanbase) that the conclusion will result in \"so much blood coming\" and so I'm putting this market together as a \"casualty pool\".  \n\nI wanna know which characters, from chapter 17 page 145 till the end of chapter 17 (see note!), will be significantly injured, mortally wounded, outright killed, or otherwise impacted in some significantly deleterious way they wouldn't\/didn't want.\n\nExamples of what I mean by the latter: getting key memories or bits of personality memory wiped, Duane being rendered incapable of his present pymary-zombie existence somehow, someone's soul being Khert-swallowed or something, etc.  Examples of \"significantly injured\" - Toma's arm qualifies.  Jivi's ear doesn't.\n\nEdit - 2023-07-05: Manifold used to have a multiple choice \/ free response format, but they've paused those temporarily to overhaul multiple choice.  So the options for this question are limited to the seven main cast characters I added.  Let's hope we can get a true free-response pool going for Chapter 18!\nFor a character to count, they must meet one of the following:\n1. Named character with at least one page appearance\/speech bubble so far, or\n2. Unnamed background character with a notable feature\/job\/role, or who has had a spoken interaction with a named character per 1, and at least two page appearances (\"the shopkeeper\" from the start of the chapter, \"pymaric chair lady\").\n\n(Feel free to add someone you think qualifies, but I reserve the right to not resolve them as a yes if in my judgment they don't meet the casualty or the significance criteria.)\n\nAlso - the injury itself need not appear.  If a character who would qualify mentions that something qualifying occurred, but we don't see it, that will count.  (Something like - final encounter, blinding pymaric effect, black out, afterwards someone says \"there's no way they survived that\").  Yes, this does leave us open to ending up being wrong later on in the story.  But Ashley's done that before, hasn't she?   \ud83d\ude01 \n\nNote - I am intentionally making this about chapter 17.  Ashley just dropped a hint that she might add a chapter 18 to the story, and so I am going to clone this market for that possibility.  Don't be mad if, when this resolves, someone's a NO only based on the chapter the injury happened!\n[Market creator] Matt C.

At the time, the difficulty level was beyond my ability, but it's been on my mind ever since. I'd like to finally meet this mountain tomorrow. \n\nThe standard Table Mountain Trail is 10.7 miles with 4,146 feet of elevation gain. The harder Table Mountain Face Trail shortens the mileage to 8.2 miles. \n\nInstead, I'd like to approach from the Wyoming side of the Teton Range starting from String Lake, hiking up Cascade Canyon, crossing Hurricane Pass, summiting Table Mountain, and descending the Face Trail to exit on the Idaho side. \n\n[image]The red and yellow sections exist as trails on Alltrails, but the blue section doesn't. There doesn't seem to be any information online, so traversing that unknown 1.3 miles is my biggest concern. It could be impassable. Snow is also a risk factor. \n\n[image]There's no good reason to hike to Table Mountain the hard way (and there's probably a good reason why this route doesn't exist on Alltrails), except to experience the mountains more fully. I've gone the length and height of the Teton Range (by backpacking 35 miles along the Teton Crest Trail and climbing 7,043 feet up Grand Teton), and now I have a chance to walk the width.\n\nWill I summit Table Mountain via this route? \n\n[image]Resolved to yes! The hike totaled 18 miles because navigating through that blue section was so ambiguous. The first 9 miles flew by in four hours, then that single offtrail mile took four hours. Now I know why no trail exists \u2014 that side of the mountain requires scrambling straight up crumbling scree at a 60-degree incline. The mountain slides under every step. But the views were breathtaking! \n\n[image]There's a sign at the exit saying, \"Face Trail, trail not maintained, very steep, not recommended\" but it turned out to be fine. Nice, even! I'm grateful for the trail builders who put in a real trail and extra grateful for the friends who met me at the end with Thai takeout. \n[Market creator] Alice\n[Creation date] 09-25-2022\n[Closing data] 09-26-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-26-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks, Daniel!

Now that I've reached my goal of climbing the Grand, will I maintain my fitness any longer? \n\nI can be very driven, obsessive even, in pursuing goals. But in the absence of a goal to dedicate myself to, is there any reason to suffer, I mean, exercise? Other than this anomaly of a year, I never exercise. I have no intention of ever doing hill sprints again unless I'm being chased by a moose.\n\nIt's ambiguous how I'd determine whether I'm maintaining equal or greater fitness. Appearance and weight are irrelevant; what matters to me is ability. When I was training I tracked metrics I needed to hit, like time per thousand feet of elevation gain. Maybe my friends can ask to hike at any time and put me on the spot, so I don't have time to prepare last-minute? And if at any time I fall below my current fitness level, I'll immediately resolve to no.

So if I ever fall below these numbers, I'll immediately resolve to no. \n---\n[Date]: 10-11-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks, that's a great point that exercise enables you to enjoy your life!

You really didn't make any unique arguments, just hopping from one to another as soon as it fails. My position has stayed the same, I had a vague title, I had a clarifying description, under my description Destiny beating the modpack did not count towards resolving yes. \n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I actually thought about doing that but these yes voters make me the most apathetic person \n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  \n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  You larp as an intellectual but you are actually stupid, all of your beliefs stem from Destiny and you have not developed any fundamental understanding of any of this shit.

A \"sneaky plan\" must be surprising and non-obvious. \"I thought I could buy enough shares to overcome the minnows\", \"I thought another whale would jump in and help me\", or any other plan that uses the natural mechanics of the market in a straightforward way doesn't count, even if Isaac expected it to happen last minute to pounce on the minnows. Examples of a sneaky plan would include taking out a secret loan from @NinthCause (or any similar pact that would metaphorically fit the description in this poem: https:\/\/manifold.markets\/IsaacKing\/will-the-whales-win-this-market#OglNi20vSFIk6EvS70nZ), paying people to bet NO and then switch to YES last minute, or manipulating the mechanics of the market in an unusual, unintuitive way that people didn't see coming.\n\nMinnows ultimately win the market because they overcame Isaac's plan. This could be by getting enough points that his plan wasn't enough to overcome it, or by performing some specific action to prevent him from executing it (e.g., convincing someone not to give him a loan or paying people to stay on Team NO). If Isaac's plan is thwarted by some outside factor (e.g., he had a plan involving alt accounts that was thwarted by Manifold's new rules), it doesn't count, unless it is clear that the minnows would have been able to thwart it anyway.\n\nNote:\n\nMinnows MUST win the WvM market for this to resolve YES. If they lose even after thwarted some plan of Isaac's, then that means that at best they only thwarted Plan A or delayed the inevitable.\n\nIf Isaac's plan required the market to stay open for longer, then minnows will be considered to have thwarted it, since the current procedure for resolving the market probably wouldn't be in place if it wasn't for minnows arguing that the market should close earlier.\n\nThe first criterion here is similar to the one used in this market: @\/CodeandSolder\/does-isaac-have-a-trick-up-his-slee. However, it is not identical. In particular, Isaac does not actually have to do something \"unexpected and interesting\" for that criterion to be met - it is enough that he planned to do something, even if he never attempted to execute it since minnows had already foiled it. \n\nSome people have already offered to sell their NO shares if they are paid to do so. If Isaac takes them up on their offer, that is not enough to meet the first criterion, unless he already had plans to do this with a lot of people beforehand.\n\nI will use my best judgement, but if there is sufficient disagreement over whether Isaac's plan should count as \"sneaky\" or not, I may resolve this to PROB.\n\nIf Isaac doesn't have a sneaky plan, this resolves NO, not N\/A.\n[Market creator] Plasma Ballin'\n[Creation date] 04-21-2023\n[Closing data] 04-30-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Pretty obvious resolution here.

On the other hand, it obviously doesn't seem correct to say that minnows didn't thwart Isaac's plan if they end up way ahead in the point totals like they are now, even if the market resolves N\/A rather than minnows winning. So, if the WvM market resolves N\/A, I will resolve this one to N\/A as well.\n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Seems like the probability of this hasn't been corrected yet for the massive gain minnows have made. Since Isaac did indeed pull off a sneaky plan by buying off an army of accounts to dwindle the minnows' numbers, we have definitely met condition one. And the plan actually worked without being thwarted by outside factors, so if minnows in fact win, it means they thwarted the plan with the last-minute giant recruiting push.  In other words, this is now pretty much guaranteed to resolve YES iff the Whales vs. Minnows market resolves NO.\n---\n[Date]: 04-25-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Looks like there's another sneaky plan:  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/IsaacKing\/will-the-whales-win-this-market#5A41LjloguD2BiIYn7c1\n---\n[Date]: 04-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  As I understand it, Isaac's plan is to get some people from an EA Facebook group to help him by promising to increase their donations. That would count as \"thwarted\" if either of the following happens: What would not count as thwarting the plan is: Of course, even if this plan fails organically, it's still possible that Isaac has another plan up his sleeve that minnows could thwart. The only outcome that definitely guarantees a NO resolution here is whales winning the market.\n","[Market title] Whales vs. Minnows: Will traders hold at least 10000x as many YES shares as there are traders holding NO shares?\n[Market description] Team Whale gets 1 point for each 10,000 YES shares they collectively hold.\n\nTeam Minnow gets 1 point for each trader holding NO shares.\n\nThe team with the most points at close wins.\n\nThe market stops normal trading activity at 18:30 Pacific time on April 24th. At this time, it enters \"pseudorandom close mode\", where it closes as soon as a bitcoin block is mined with a hash that ends in \"00\". (With 144 blocks per day and hexidecimal hashes, this means it'll likely resolve within 2 days.) I probably won't be online at the exact time the block is mined, so I'll just resolve the market whenever I get back and see that this has occurred. (It'll resolve based on the state it was in at the time the block was mined; any new investements from team Whale or new traders on Team Minnow afterwards won't count.) The information source on bitcoin hashes and mining times we'll use is here.\n\nAll NO shareholders count towards team minnow's points, except:\n\nAny account that has declared itself to be an alt, and is not a bot account.\n\nAccounts that have been banned from Manifold.\n\nA \"bot account\" refers to any account with the \"bot\" tag that is clearly not human-controlled and has a good reason to exist as a separate account. (e.g. @acc and @Botlab)\n\nIf anyone is suspicious that an account may be an undeclared alt being used to unfairly inflate team minnow's points, (which is a violation of Manifold's community guidelines), they should report that account to Manifold using the \"report\" button on that account's profile page. Market resolution may be delayed for up to a month after close to allow Manifold to investigate these reports.\n\nThe resolution council may choose to disqualify some suspected alt accounts, even if Manifold has not banned them.\n\nNote that I phrased the market description in terms of \"points\" to make it more intuitive, but the title is the technically correct resolution. i.e. Team Whale can get fractional points, and they'll win a tie.  (But a tie is extremely unlikely, since buying just 1 more share can break the tie.)\n\nGiven the disagreements and ambiguity about this market's close date and resolution criteria, and the fact that I'm both the market creator and one of its largest shareholders, I have delegated its management to @jack, @Conflux, and @MartinRandall. They have final say over all descisions, and it's effectively \"their market\".\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 04-03-2023\n[Closing data] 04-29-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Usually the word \"cheating\" refers to  breaking  the rules.

But will the ultimate resolution even be controversial?\n\nThis market will resolve YES if I notice significant disagreement over the resolution itself or whether factors that led to the resolution were handled fairly. This would include, for example, disagreements over the list of alt accounts, controversy over the time of the market closing, or credible accusations that someone knew the time that the market would close and used that to their advantage. However, any such controversies have to be over factors significant enough to affect the resolution - if people disagree whether a specific account is someone's alt, but the market would resolve the same way regardless, that is not enough for a YES resolution here.\n\nOne obvious way this could resolve YES is if any of the derivative markets claims that Isaac has resolved the market incorrectly by some metric (assuming that the derivative market isn't unambiguously agreed to have resolved incorrectly). However, this market could still resolve YES even if all the derivative markets agree that the original was resolved correctly, as long as there is some significant controversy among traders.\n\nI will also take into account how sincere the disagreements are. If someone seems to be just claiming that they disagree with the resolution to get this market to resolve YES, I will ignore them. I will also ignore anyone who is just being a sore loser by contesting the results, unless they can make a serious case that it shouldn't have been resolved the way it was.\n\nWhales vs. Minnows:\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/IsaacKing\/will-the-whales-win-this-market)\n[Market creator] Plasma Ballin'\n[Creation date] 04-09-2023\n[Closing data] 05-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-01-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]: Well, no new information has been brought to my attention since my previous comment, and no one has complained about the NO resolution in the comments on WvM, or anywhere else that I noticed.

Minnows were ahead at every single suggested close time, so the arguments over the closing time did not ultimately affect the resolution. You could claim that, counterfactually, whales might have been ahead earlier if the closing time had been set to earlier, but I have already stated that I'm not going to consider a counterfactual argument like that when determining what affects the resolution, since it's impossible to verify. Similarly, none of the controversies about the exclusion of alts, Isaac's use of API keys, or the mana refund affected the resolution, so they don't count either.  Currently, the only argument that seems to be serious and good faith for why the market should not have resolved the way it did is  's argument that it should have resolved N\/A. Others have expressed a similar sentiment, but I can't find anyone else making statements strong enough to conclude that they disagree with the NO resolution (I thought I found  such a statement  from   on the Manifold discord, but he has since then edited it to cross out the comment, leading me to assume that it was either just a joke or that he no longer agrees with it). I don't think that statements from only a single person are sufficient to count as \"significant disagreement\", and it's also not yet clear whether it's actually the resolution that Odoacre disagrees with, as opposed to the allowance of the market (see  here ). I will leave this open for a little longer just in case something else comes up and to give people an opportunity to bring any new evidence of controversy to my attention. However, I don't think there is sufficient controversy, and I will resolve this market NO if I am not given any new reasons to resolve it YES soon.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I don't think that's very good evidence, though. This market is currently much lower than 50%, which suggests that most people think that the WvM market is, in fact, not controversial. People might be holding a YES position because they misread or misunderstood the resolution criteria (e.g., you were initially confused about why it hadn't already resolved YES because you didn't realize that the controversies over close times, alts, and API keys wouldn't count if the market resolved NO). They could also be holding YES shares because they believe that the probability that my judgement differs from theirs is >9%. Also, I don't think the volatility of this market is a sign at all. The big swings in this market were a result of the big swings in the WvM market, since the outcome depended significantly on how WvM resolved (e.g., it went up to >90% at the same time that WvM did, since I had already stated that this market would resolve YES if WvM resolved YES). Ever since it became clear that WvM was going to resolve NO, this market has stayed fairly stable, with a few spikes that were quickly corrected and just now a large drop as the resolution actually came, eliminating any possibility of an N\/A resolution or a sudden whale comeback.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  So, would you consider your disagreement to be more of a disagreement with the existence of the market itself (or at least its continued existence), rather than the resolution? Now that it has resolved NO, do you think that the council has made the wrong decision? (You can keep or sell your YES shares if you want. Even if it did influence my decision, that would just mean that your holding the YES shares gave me some information that I considered relevant to the resolution, which isn't a bad thing. The only person whose shares could unduly affect the resolution is me, and I already sold all my shares and avoided buying any more once it looked like the resolution might require a judgement call).\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  This doesn't seem like a reasonable complaint to me, and I haven't heard anyone else complain about this, so I'm not inclined to consider it a significant disagreement.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Some of these are just predicting N\/A, though, and even the ones that suggest that resolving the market N\/A would be good don't really seem to be saying that resolving to something other than N\/A would be a misresolution. What I am looking for is disagreement over the resolution, i.e., if it resolves NO, will there be people who think, \"This isn't right, it should have resolved N\/A\"? None of these comments give me a strong enough sense that the users would disagree if the market were to resolve NO. I agree that these comments are reasonable and sincere, the question is just whether they are enough to constitute a controversy if the WvM market resolves NO. My current thinking is that these comments alone aren't enough to prove that a NO resolution is controversial. If it does resolve NO, though, I will try to get the opinions of people who previously made statements in favor of an N\/A resolution to see if they disagree with the resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Feel free to make that market if you want.

Also, if you have an argument for why the current calls to resolve it N\/A should be enough to consider a NO resolution controversial no matter what else happens, I would like to hear it because it might impact my decision on how to resolve this.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  It theoretically could have led to a controversial resolution, but it's back open now, and I don't think anyone can reasonably argue that the market being closed for ~3 hr will affect the result.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  The reason it hasn't resolved YES is because, as stated in the description, the controversy has to be over a factor that ultimately affects the resolution. So the controversies over the close time and Isaac's use of API keys to turn technically real accounts into alts in all but name would only count if WvM resolves YES (which is why I have stated in previous comments that this market will definitely resolve YES if WvM resolves YES). If it still resolves NO in spite of these things, then the NO resolution will be uncontroversial (assuming no other controversies), since it would have resolved NO whether or not the time was extended and whether or not Isaac used API keys, and therefore, people on both sides of these controversies can agree that the NO resolution is correct. At this point, since WvM is very unlikely to resolve YES, the main controversy that could affect the results is controversy over whether it should be N\/A'ed. If it does resolve N\/A, I would probably consider it controversial, since I assume it would be perceived as another bailout for Isaac (but unlike the mana refund, it would be a controversial bailout that actually affects the resolution), and people would argue that it should resolve to a definite answer, since one side has a definite lead in points. But if it resolves NO, I'm not sure whether it would be controversial or not. I have seen people arguing for an N\/A resolution, and if they still argue that it should have been N\/A'ed even after it resolves NO, I would definitely count that as enough to make the resolution controversial. If everyone seems to accept the NO resolution, though, even people who previously suggested N\/Aing it, I don't think I would count it as controversial.\n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Where things stand now: A YES resolution seems very unlikely, but if it somehow does happen, it would count as controversial, even though that controversy is probably not really the first thing on people's minds now. Some have suggested an N\/A resolution, which would probably be controversial, since people would see it as bailing out Isaac and some would lose their profits. A NO resolution seems most likely, and probably the least likely to be controversial, but if enough people argue for an N\/A resolution, a NO resolution could still be considered controversial. \n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I don't consider that part of the resolution. This is only meant to refer to the value that it gets resolved to: YES, NO, N\/A, or a probability. The only form of bailing Isaac out that would count is if the market resolves N\/A in light of the drama, and people argue that this is just a bail-out for Isaac. Manifold giving Isaac a refund for the mana he bought won't affect the final outcome of the market, so it won't count here, even if it is controversial.\n---\n[Date]: 04-25-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Also, maybe I should have stated this more clearly in the description, but my intention was always that, if there was reasonable doubt over how the market would resolve if a controversy was handled differently, then it would count as \"significant enough to affect the resolution\". For example, if the controversy over the closing date had been reversed (people wanted it open longer, but it closed earlier), then I would have resolved this YES even though we wouldn't know for sure whether the earlier close date really affected the resolution. I only meant to rule out things that unambiguously didn't affect the resolution with that clause (e.g., if minnows had been winning at the original close time, and then still won).\n---\n[Date]: 04-25-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  It may indeed be true that, counterfactually, Team Whale still would have won if the market had resolved earlier. But that is also impossible to verify, so I don't think that it's enough to say the controversy didn't affect the results. I have already stated in previous comments that the controversy will be considered to have impacted the results if one team is in the lead at the original close time, and then the other team wins, which (assuming Team Whale wins) is what happened. Since I already said that this was how I was determining the significance in the comments, I don't think I should go back and that and base it on hypothetical reasoning.\n---\n[Date]: 04-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That is pretty much correct. As I mentioned below, the controversy over the closure date will be considered to have affected the result iff Team Whale wins.

In other words, if Team Minnow wins, and would have won no matter what, this market will resolve NO, since the NO resolution of the WvM market won't be controversial (It may be controversial how it should have resolved, but everyone will agree that NO is the correct resolution, which is what this market is about). So the outcome of this market isn't guaranteed, and is now pretty much completely dependent on the outcome of the WvM market.\n---\n[Date]: 04-20-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Update: As I assume everyone here already knows, there is now an official time that the WvM market is set to go into pseudorandom mode, decided by a council of three users. It is set to do this on April 24, although the council agreed that April 17 was when it should have happened based on the original description.  If the market had gone into pseudorandom mode in accordance with the original description, it would have already resolved, since a Bitcoin block with a hash ending in 00 has already been mined since April 17:  https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/explorer\/blocks\/btc\/786174 Since Team Minnow was in the lead at the time when this block was mined, the controversy over the close date will be considered to have affected the result if and only if Team Whale ends up winning. (This assumes that it doesn't resolve N\/A, which I think is a valid assumption given that the council has decided on a resolution procedure, and not to N\/A it). In other words, this market is more or less guaranteed to resolve to the same result as the WvM market.\n---\n[Date]: 04-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Today is the day that the WvM market would go into pseudorandom mode according to the common interpretation that it should do so a week after the original close date if it doesn't look like it will close anytime soon by the other method. Team NO has a substantial lead, and I assume they will keep that lead for the rest of the time the market would be open according to this interpretation. However, it appears that Isaac intends to keep the market open for longer. If both of those assumptions are true, then this market is pretty much guaranteed to resolve in the same way as the WvM market itself (unless the WvM market resolves N\/A). So I'm not sure why this market is 10% higher than WvM.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  To be clear, I still think that this market is more likely than not to have a clear resolution. I outlined some cases above, and I think the first two are almost certain to lead to either an unambiguous NO or an unambiguous YES. Those are also the cases I think are most likely. The third, fifth, and sixth cases could be ambiguous, but they could also be very clear. The fourth case could make it somewhat difficult to resolve this market, but even then, it might be obvious, and I think the fourth case is very unlikely to happen anyway. My comment wasn't really meant to imply that I don't know how I should resolve this market, just that it's  possible  that we end up in a situation where I'm not sure how to resolve it. In that case, I would consider resolving it N\/A, but only if I am really uncertain about my own opinion and there is no consensus among others for how it should resolve. My plan is to either resolve the market on my own if it is obvious, and otherwise to get the opinions of traders to see if we can come to a consensus. If not, I would still consider resolving it according to a poll, rather than just N\/Aing it.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Since this depends on both the outcome of the WvM market and how people react to that outcome, it is hard to say exact how I would resolve it in every case, but based on the current debate, here is what I'm thinking: To be clear, even in the situations that I think might lead to an ambiguity, I think it is still possible that it becomes obvious when the time comes, since people who disagree with the resolution will make their disagreements known.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I am slightly worried that the resolution to  this  market could become controversial under certain circumstances, since it is still somewhat ambiguous what counts as controversial, even though I've tried to clarify it as much as possible. I would make a market about that, but it wouldn't make sense for me to be the one to judge whether my own market is controversial, since, in the event that it really is controversial, it would be my own judgement over what is and isn't controversial that's called into question. If anyone else wants to make a market about it, though, that is perfectly fine with me. In the event that it really is hard to determine whether the resolution to the WvM market was controversial, I will discuss it with traders here and possibly in the original market before resolving.\n---\n[Date]: 04-12-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Update on how I am inclined to resolve this: The original disagreement mentioned below was about whether \"in a week\" refers to \"a week after market creation\" or \"a week after the original close date\". It seems like the disagreement over this has faded now that it has been clarified to refer to the original close date rather than the date of market creation, so I'm not sure whether I would count it as controversial if that is the sole ambiguity that affects the results. I think if that ends up being the deciding factor, I will try to get the opinions of people who originally interpreted it the other way and see if they are okay with the resolution. Personally, I think this is a reasonable clarification, but this is about whether there will be controversy, not whether I think the ultimate resolution is correct. Now, though, it seems that there are bigger disagreements over the closure time, mainly because of the vagueness in what \"meaningful progress\" means and because there is seemingly a contradiction between, \"If after a week it looks like it won't be closing any time soon, I'll close it at a pseudorandom time within the next few days,\" and \"the market will remain open for as long as it looks like meaningful progress is being made towards its final state.\" I think I would resolve this market YES if the latter factor affects the ultimate resolution to the Whales vs. Minnows market. In other words, if the market doesn't switch to pseudo-random mode at most a week after its original closing date, and this affects the resolution, I am inclined to resolve this YES. For the other factor (the definition of \"meaningful progress\"), I think it depends on whether all sides of the debate can come to a consensus before the market closes.\n---\n[Date]: 04-10-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: There is currently controversy over the closing time of the market. The description had some ambiguities over when the market will switch to \"pseudo-random mode\", and many people bet on it assuming that it would close earlier that it might actually end up closing. I would be inclined to resolve this YES if this ambiguity affects the ultimate resolution, unless people who were confused about the closing time say that they would have bet the same way regardless, or that they don't have a problem with the final resolution once it comes. As Isaac stated below, people questioning the final closing time is the most likely way for the outcome to be controversial. Also, one user suggested to resolve the market N\/A due to the ambiguity. Isaac has already stated that he won't do this, but if he changes his mind and ends up resolving N\/A, I expect that to anger many people and would probably consider that a controversial resolution as well.\n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Lol, I fixed the typo now \n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yes, I wouldn't consider misreading the description to be a credible reason to contest the resolution. \n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That's my assumption as well. It seems very unlikely that the list of alt accounts would determine the outcome, and even if it does, I imagine that no account will be on that list unless it's pretty clear-cut.

Then the market will be held open for an additional 6 months(June 1, 2025) and resolved 50%.\n\nResolves NO if:\n\nNo alignment-focused organization receives the weights of an interpretability model from OpenAI by December 31, 2024.\n\nResolves as NA if:\n\nOpenAI ceases to exist, or the listed organizations merge, dissolve, or undergo significant restructuring, rendering the original intent of the market unclear or irrelevant.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nA language model is an algorithm that processes and generates human language by assigning probabilities to sequences of tokens (words, characters, or subword units) based on learned patterns from training data. They can then be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text prediction, text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more. Language models use statistical or machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformer architectures, to capture the complex relationships between words and phrases in a language.\n\n\"Interpretability model\" refers to a language model created by OpenAI with the primary goal of facilitating better understanding of the inner workings, decision-making processes, and learning mechanisms of the model, as opposed to models optimized solely for performance or prediction accuracy. An accompanying article should emphasize interpretability, and an accompanying technical report should report interpretability benchmarks that can judge other language models. Model must not have been released before this market's creation. While performance is not the primary goal, it must be competitive on benchmarks with language models at most 2 years behind it (this excludes the possibility of e.g. a Markov Chain being presented).\n\n\"OpenAI\" mainly means OpenAI, but additionally any executive or heavy investor is allowed to make the announcement. So if Microsoft makes the announcement, it will count. If OpenAI is acquired, the name refers to the acquirer. If OpenAI dissolves, this market resolves NA.\n\n\"Credible evidence\" means journalistic reporting alluding to credible sources, statements by employees or former employees, or similar.\n\n\"Alignment-focused Organization\" refers to Anthropic, Redwood Research, Alignment Research Center, Center for Human Compatible AI, Machine Intelligence Research Institute, or Conjecture. Additional examples may be added - if there is a dispute, a poll may be taken. A public release of weights counts as releasing to these organizations. A leaked release also counts, as long as the model is confirmed to have been developed with the purpose fo being interpretable. \"Red-teaming\" of capabilities does not count.\n\nMarket description can be freely adjusted within one week after market creation. After that, I will only refine to narrower meanings or to have additional examples added.\n[Market creator] Mira \ud83e\udd9a\n[Creation date] 03-26-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2025\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  yes\n","[Market title] Will LLMs' non-language capabilities be used commercially by the end of 2023?\n[Market description] Copywriting, translating, conversing, semantic search, data labelling, text summarisation, and code generation are all established uses of LLMs that are being commercialised.

Will I believe this has happened by the end of 2023?\n\nThis resolves positively if the nature of its use is extended by being given an interface with other software, but there has to be evidence of it being used (sustainably) for real commercial applications.

I personally expect the code interpreter plugin is what's going to resolve this first:  Greg Brockman on Twitter: \"Plugins for processing a video clip, no ffmpeg wizardry required. All I'm waiting for are reports of it being consistently used end-to-end for something like that (processing a video clip) for revenue-generating purposes. Generating the code isn't sufficient (that counts as a language task) but taking a file and spitting out what people want definitely is \u2014 the idea of something like ChatGPT replacing standalone video processing software is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind. So basically, all that's left is having good evidence that this kind of capability is being used for commercial applications. There probably just needs to be a video of an established content creator demonstrating how they use ChatGPT as part of their regular workflow, or something like that.

I'm wanting to ask about LLMs specifically because I want to track the claims in the Nostalgebraist blog (which is focused on GPT-4), as well as Sam Altman's claims about the 'middle layer' (AI firms that interact with LLMs specifically). People seem to claim that LLMs specifically can go very far, and I'm interested in tracking that rather than AI progress as a whole.  I do agree that non-language models are very likely to be better at non-language things!\n---\n[Date]: 01-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  yep, that's a good way of putting it (generalising away from language) but a bit of cross training is okay (e.g. Cicero).

I don't think any factor would be sufficient, since the nature of usage wouldn't be different.  However, if there was LLM-based software resembling a software engineer more closely, that would count. The difference needs to be that its capabilities are notably extended beyond language (ie beyond just code generation). If it can (for example) autonomously compile a program, run it, alter the source code in response to the errors\/output, and repeat \u2014 then the nature of its use just changed. I'm sure someone could spin up a prototype of something like that (if they haven't already) but there would have to be evidence that businesses use it (and not just experimentally) to resolve this positively.

If a language model exists that is undoubtedly the most accurate, reliable, capable, and powerful, that model will win regardless of popularity (provided, at least some members of the public have access).\n\nIf there is dispute as to which is more powerful, a significant popularity\/accessibility advantage will most likely decide the winner. There must be public access for it to be eligible.\n\nThe three main metrics for assessment:\n\n1. Popularity and Accessibility\n\nAssessed in real-terms. Total users and engagement (if public), otherwise I will defer to google trends or other publicly available data which can provide relative measures of popularity. \n\nThis metric is arguably most important, but is not the only factor as if an Android or iPhone AI gets pushed to existing OS, the existing assistant leaders in those areas (e.g. Siri, Google Assistant) will have a meaningful advantage, irrespective of product quality. \n\nThe popularity and userbase elements are essentially being used as a substitute for \"usefulness\".\n\n2. Accuracy and Reliability\n\nAssessed against a common set of questions or data, to be determined. I expect there will be studies or other academic materials published which I hope to refer to. If these papers conclude that \"ExampleRacistBot\" is more accurate than chatGPT because of censoring, etc. then \"ExampleRacistBot\" would be the more accurate model.\n\n3. Power & Capability\n\nTotal computational ability, based on whichever metrics seem most relevant at the time. Right now those might be: \n\nNumber of Parameters\n\nTokens\/words processed\n\nProblem-solving abilities\n\nTrainability (an example of an ongoing trainability exercise with GPT4: @\/Mira\/will-a-prompt-that-enables-gpt4-to \n\nIf there are any recommendations for Power & Capability metrics, please let me know. The biggest issue I see is that if I establish which metrics are most important (say; number of parameters, like everyone did for GPT3) we may end up in a situation like we are now, where GPT4 parameters are not disclosed. Expect this criteria to change over time.\n\nResolution Assessment\n\nWhen the final assessment is being made, if there aren't reliable competitive grounds for comparison, the following series of checks are how I see the decisionmaking process going.\n\n\nFirst check: Popularity. If one model is evidently significantly more popular (like >50% market share, or more popular by Google Trend metrics, etc.), then it will be considered the best unless there is evidence suggesting an alternative public AI is more accurate and powerful. If multiple models are within a similar frame of power and accuracy, popularity will determine the winner.\n\nSecond check: If there are multiple models of similar popularity, accuracy and power will determine the winner. If there are no good academic comparisons for accuracy, I will endeavour to conduct my own, but I'm really hoping someone else figures that out before I have to. Accuracy seems more tied to \"usefulness\" than power, but if there is a significant breakthrough in power such that one has a capability advantage over the other (like advanced logic problem solving) while maintaining accuracy, and for whatever reason it's not more popular but still public, that will win. \n\nThird check: If there are multiple models of comparable popularity (or there is terrible data available) and there is no real clear difference in the capability, power, or accuracy - the decision will be deferred to more specific considerations, like a Google Trends comparison (relative search popularity) or the number of parameters (provided this is public, and still a respected metric)\n\nIf the decision becomes highly-subjective, I will sell all of my positions, donate the profits, and defer judgement to someone I deem to be an expert (and have reasonable access to) who will make the final call. I'll probably just email professors until I get a response, or ask someone enrolled in a related course at the time to ask their professor to respond.\n\n[ Taking advice for updates or any proposed criteria changes ]\n\nCompeting for @AmmonLam's subsidy\n\n[Changelog]\n\n01\/05\/2023: Description updated to reflect thoughts expanded on in comments\n[Market creator] Genzy\n[Creation date] 05-01-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Definitely worth typing, and you bring up something important I am willing to defer to people with more AI expertise, but afaik GPT4 is rumoured to be an MoE which basically sounds like 8 models Frankenstein'ed together. If someone else launches a client that Frankenstein's multiple models (that aren't openAI's) and somehow it's better than the best openAI product\/model\/whatever - that should count. However, it can't be something like poe which just plugs you into the different models, it would need to be one input field (within reason, as chatGPT has multiple input fields where you can modify your prompts by telling it your name\/job\/etc) that makes the selections behind the scenes and provides an output. I should also say though, the comparison is for the \"language model\" part. I don't think any multimodal stuff should impact the decision here outside of the impact it will inevitably have on the popularity or market share\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  The main reason is because if one org undeniably creates an AGI that is publicly available, it seems possible that openAI could use that AGI to improve their own to be competitive and retain their current market share If another company has a serious breakthrough, or finds a better way to improve accuracy (e.g. by removing all corporate bloat) I don\u2019t want openAI to have a chance to copy their success However if openAI are cooking up something more akin to \u201cSimultaneous invention\u201d, e.g they have their own improved model that is \u201cbetter\u201d but it\u2019s built differently and they\u2019ve had it in the back for a while, then I\u2019ll wait to see what they release If you haven\u2019t already, read my comments\/replies to others too \ud83d\ude04\n---\n[Date]: 12-12-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Nah I think it would be cringe to do that, the way I wrote it just now in a comment below: BUT If they're super close, or even within the same league, I think we should wait.

It's really about the best consumer product, I guess. The question is ultimately about the best from openAI vs the best everywhere else. Whichever is \"the best\" will win If someone releases a model that is better than the best available openAI model, then this market will resolve YES. However, as it seems extremely unlikely that openAI are going to \"fall off\" in a major way and make the resolution obvious, I will likely be comparing the best LLM's publicly available at the end of the year. The world vs openAI.  If Google released Gemini-Gigachad which was a confirmed AGI that never made mistakes and could beat stockfish at chess, I would resolve YES immediately. As a note, I have absolutely no intention on resolving this YES because of Gemini, and it will only be considered if down the road their best version is made available and it is either widely used or confirmed to definitely be better.

I have found (disappointingly) that the ChatGPT stats are mostly just based on website visits (1.6B in March), and I expect that regular users for the assistant software I mentioned would outnumber GPT (both Siri and google assistant have estimates around 500Million users, roughly 25% of iPhone users use Siri to search for shopping products) I am trying to find a more reliable metric and am open to the use of Google Trends comparisons. I will update the description to reflect this. As for comparing the computational ability, I am relying on the fact that there will be some competitive motivation for benchmarking in the next two years (\ud83d\ude4f). I'm a little hesitant to put exact conditions as there may be new scores or tests that become relevant over time, but if you or anyone else has a metric they want noted\/recorded (that will hopefully be made public by the AI publishers) then I will take it on board. I will update the description to reflect this further, and I intend over time to consistently adjust the \"Power & Capability\" criteria in line with consumer expectations for outputs and what data becomes publicly available.  Ultimately, the mention of multiple criteria is to primarily establish that something like an Android\/iPhone AI push won't count simply on userbase, and that a less powerful, more reliable AI would only be in contention if it was also extremely popular - given that in this case, popularity is a proxy for usefulness. If my judgement becomes a key factor in this, and its highly disputable, I will defer to an expert (or a group of experts) if it is possible (I also have no issues donating any profits & closing my position).\n---\n[Date]: 05-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I mostly added the diversity of metrics because I didn't want it to be an autowin if Apple pushed some product to every iPhone that is 80% as good but defacto more popular because it's free and accessible.

Let's see if he's \"proposed and\/or debated an LVT policy measure.\" From the article: \"That's why Addison said he pushes for a tax reform that would tax land value separately from the building and potentially lower taxable value of the property itself. \"If we looked at decoupling our property, the home versus the land, we could look at how zoning dictates value changes of the land itself. Then we tax what the land is worth rather than being dependent on what the building is,\" Addison said. He said this approach would create an incentive to build on vacant parking lots and encourage development. Addison added, as a land-locked city, it would give Richmond more economic control. \u201cThe land\u2019s value is dictated by very controllable assets: zoning type, density, height, usage, proximity to other assets, parks, schools, facilities, etc. It becomes a very different formula than just depending on, 'hey, look, the interest rates went down, people are buying and selling homes, my assessment value goes up, the city makes more money,'\" he said. While land value taxation is not widely known or practiced, Addison said City Council approved a study and community engagement process that would analyze the possible impacts of implementing such a reform. Results will take about six to nine months.\" That certainly seems like it qualifies on both of these measures:  - Elected officials proposing and\/or debating an LVT policy measure  - Commissioning a new report on the subject that they haven't already done as of the posting of this question Based on the above evidence, this resolves YES.

At the time of this writing, the iPhone 15 has not yet been released, so the iPhone 16 is likely several years away.\n\n\nThe question of whether or not the iPhone 16 will have a charging port is a topic of speculation and debate among technology enthusiasts and industry analysts. Apple has been a trendsetter in the smartphone industry, often introducing new features that are subsequently adopted by other manufacturers. One such example is the removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, which sparked a wider trend in the industry.\n\nApple has been experimenting with wireless charging technology for several years and has already released devices that support wireless charging. Some analysts speculate that the iPhone 16 may not have a physical charging port at all and will rely entirely on wireless charging. Others believe that Apple may adopt a new type of charging port or continue to use the Lightning port that has been a staple of the iPhone series for many years.\n\nClose date updated to 2024-07-31 11:59 pm\n[Market creator] Patrick\n[Creation date] 02-16-2023\n[Closing data] 08-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Apple will spend $10+ billion on acquisitions outside its core business in 2023\n[Market description] Resolves YES if Apple acquires at least one surprising company, for at least $10 billion in total, in 2023; broadly speaking, the acquisition must be considered a diversification \u2013 expand beyond Apple's core business in electronic devices and directly related services and platforms. The acquisition must be confirmed by Apple and reported on by mainstream media sources.\n\nResolves NO if Apple does not make acquisitions that meet the above criteria before the end of 2023.\n\n$10 billion is a proxy for an order of magnitude of companies like Fiat Chrysler. \u201cSurprising choice\u201d will be evaluated subjectively, as it can include acquiring companies like Disney, whose sector is arguably already somewhat represented in Apple\u2019s portfolio (Apple TV+).\n\nContext: All-in podcast, E110, \u201c2023 Bestie Predictions!\u201d\n\nDavid Friedberg: \u201c[Prediction for the biggest business deal of 2023.] So my wild card is I think Apple ends up buying something completely out of the ordinary. I think Apple's core business, they're facing significant pressure with respect to their relationship and ties to China. (\u2026) They're also under a lot of political pressure because of the app store revenues. (\u2026) There's also the pressure with respect to the waning consumer demand for high end electronics. (\u2026) So when you put all of this together, (\u2026) they have to do something big to kind of diversify the business. So I think they might end up doing something like buying a real content company, maybe they do something like buy Disney, Maybe they do something like buy an automotive company, like Fiat Chrysler. I think there are number of these, what may seem today, outrageous deals that Apple might end up kind of being pressured into. (\u2026) I certainly have no insight or intel on anything or I could be completely wrong on this one, but it feels like they've got to do something this year in order to keep that business growing.\u201d \n\nJason Calacanis: \u201cI mean, now with Tesla, with this depressed stock price, Apple can make a run at Tesla.

The intent of this market is mainly to gauge the likelihood of this feature in a consumer-purchasable device, so it gets fuzzy when you release something \u201cintended for developers\u201d. For example, something akin to Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro or Mac Pro lines would count, since it\u2019s purchasable by anyone, but some kind of heavily-restricted dev kit that you have to apply for would not.  Historically the only time I can remember Apple ever releasing a proper dev kit was when they released  some early Mac Minis as their first computers with Apple Silicon.  You had to apply for that, and the computers had to be \u201creturned to Apple at the end of the program\u201d, so something like that wouldn\u2019t count in my book.  If it gets really fuzzy\/controversial I might have to resolve to N\/A but I\u2019m going to try to avoid that and stick to these principles.  Also, because this resolves on announcement and not release, I expect it would be unlikely that they would release a screenless dev kit without announcing an eventual consumer product at the same-ish time. \n---\n[Date]: 01-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Related market on a potential software feature:\n---\n[Date]: 01-06-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Sure, that counts as a \u201creproduction\u201d of them in my book. \n---\n[Date]: 01-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The Information  has reaffirmed their story on the presence of this display once again.  https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/01\/03\/report-reveals-wave-of-features-for-apple-headset\/\n","[Market title] Will facebook anounce a future integration of Oculus with a brain machine interface before the end of 2022 ?\n[Market description] This question resolve to yes if during an event or in an official press release, facebook or one of its big subsidiaries announce working on integrating a brain machine interface to an oculus product or to another facebook owned, hardware platform for virtual reality.\n\nThe question was prompted by this articles where it says that in 2017, facebook revealed that it was working on a brain machine wearable interface. \n\nhttps:\/\/roboticsbiz.com\/the-history-of-brain-computer-interfaces-bcis-timeline\/\n\nAug 21, 4:26pm: \n\nAug 21, 5:03pm: \n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-11-13 10:48 pm\n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-12-31 11:55 pm\n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-11-14 1:00 am\n[Market creator] yomun\n[Creation date] 08-21-2022\n[Closing data] 11-14-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-14-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for the input!

He mentions that it lets you control an ar or a vr device. ( He says he can't show us the facebook ar device  in the demo for now ) The description of the market mentionned  \"during an event or in an official press release, facebook or one of its big subsidiaries announce working on integrating a brain machine interface to an oculus product or to another facebook owned, hardware platform for virtual reality.\" * * A demo of a working prototype by the CEO of Meta during (one of ) its most important yearly communication event is as close as possible to, and in my opinion qualifies as, an official announcement. More important it's a clear signal by Meta leadership that integrating neural imputs with XR devices is a strategic path they are working on.  They sent that signal this year, earlier, than any of us would have anticipated.  By resolving the prediction market, I am going with what I think is the spirit of the bet while staying  close to the letter the bet. But more importantly I think it provides more social utility to bettors and bystanders to resolve it, since if we go by the current odds of the market, it updates  dramatically our prior beliefs regarding facebook future and its prospects as an investment.

As to why the next 12 months are special. I would argue that Facebook is trying to create a narrative to sustain its valuation in the face of tiktok onslaught. It has settled on VR\/Metaverse but the tepid  reception of facebook horizons so far is endangering that strategy.

They could be alien technology or secret Earth technology, either one resolves this to YES.\n\nOtherwise this resolves to NO once any of the following are true:\n\nWe have a clear explanation for all outstanding credible claims. (e.g. the \"tic tac\" UFO that several people claim to have seen at close range.)\n\nThere's no longer any serious discussion about whether UFOs are real and pretty much all of humanity agrees they're not. (Similar to the current stance on the Earth being round.)\n\nWe've discovered the theory of everything and know that such UFOs would not be possible to build.\n\nWe've explored >90% of the Milky Way and have not found any signs of other spacefaring life, and we are not yet known to have invented such technology ourselves.\n\nUFOs that turn out to be normal planes or balloons don't count; in order for this market to resolve to YES, they have to be something that uses much more advanced technology than is publically known. (e.g. flying with no control surfaces, able to survive g-forces that no known plane could survive, able to hover with no apparent source of thrust, etc.) If it turns out to be advanced hologram or mind-altering technlogy used to fool people into thinking they saw a UFO, that also resolves NO.\n\nThis market is only about UFOs observed prior to market creation. Though of course if we later find a new UFO that is such advanced technology, that would be strong evidence towards some of the earlier ones having been as well.\n\nTo bet on whether they're of human or extraterrestrial origin, see @\/IsaacKing\/if-any-ufos-are-highly-advanced-tec \n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 11-18-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2100\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  It is, but it's not what this market is asking about.\n---\n[Date]: 09-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: This market is only about UFOs observed prior to market creation.

He further alleges that the Intelligence Community has intentionally withheld classified evidence of \"intact and partially intact craft of non-human origin\" and fragments \"of exotic origin (non-human intelligence, whether extraterrestrial or unknown origin)\" from congressional oversight. This has led to an ongoing investigation in response to his whistleblower complaint.\n\nOn the other hand, the Department of Defense has stated that the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AARO) has not found any information substantiating claims of any programs related to the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials. They, however, assured their commitment to following the data and the investigation wherever it may lead.\n\nThis prediction market seeks to speculate on whether David Charles Grusch's claims will be substantiated by December 31, 2023. The resolution of this market will be based on official reports or statements from the authorities involved in the investigation, such as the Office of Naval Intelligence, AARO, or any other relevant government body.\n\nFor the purpose of this market, 'substantiated' will mean that the claims made by Grusch are officially confirmed as true in part or in full by the investigating authorities.\n\nThis is a YES or NO market.\n\nYES: The authorities have officially confirmed that some or all of Grusch's claims are true by December 31, 2023.\n\nNO: The authorities have not confirmed Grusch's claims, have refuted them, or have not released any statement regarding the claims by December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the event of ambiguous or contradictory statements from different authorities, the market creator will make the final decision based on the preponderance of the evidence.\n[Market creator] Franklin Baldo\n[Creation date] 06-06-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 06-08-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:   https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/UFOs\/comments\/141up7z\/pentagon_aaro_response_to_david_grusch_claims_of\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button Got it here\n","[Market title] Will a Chinese Spy Balloon be shot down over the continental US in 2023?\n[Market description] See ABC \/ CNN.

A judge would then share the request, called a rogatory letter, with the federal Justice Ministry in Brazil, which would share it with the U.S. Department of Justice.  Neither the Justice Department nor Brazilian authorities can compel Mr. Santos to respond at this point.

Ross?\n[Market description] See this Vox article for a good primer on why this case is important:\n\nNational Pork Producers Council v. Ross \u2014 hinges on a simple question: Can California set its own standards for how pigs are treated on farms, even when they\u2019re raised in other states?\n\nThe case centers, quite literally, on how sausage gets made in the US. Each year, over 6 million female breeding pigs, or sows, are raised in \u201cgestation crates\u201d \u2014 narrow metal crates that confine the pigs so tightly they\u2019re unable to turn around for the duration of their four-month pregnancies (and they have about four pregnancies in their three- to four-year lifetimes). As the pioneering animal welfare scientist Temple Grandin once put it, the crates are akin to forcing a human to live much of their life in an airline seat.\n\nThe American Public Health Association says confining pigs so intensively also increases their stress levels and weakens their immune systems, which makes them more susceptible to infectious disease. (And given the ease with which some zoonotic viruses can pass from swine to humans, that threatens us as well.)\n\nIn 2018, over 62 percent of California voters supported a state ballot measure called Proposition 12 that would ban the crates and require sows be raised with at least 24 square feet of space. Importantly, the measure applied whether or not the pigs had been raised in California, so all whole, uncooked pork sold in the state would be required to be produced according to California\u2019s standard. Given the vast size of the state\u2019s market, it\u2019s having a transformative effect for pigs across the country \u2014 just as California\u2019s stricter emissions standards for automobiles have changed the way cars are made nationwide.\n\nThe law has similar provisions for cage-free eggs and crate-free veal, which have already gone into effect \u2014 the challenge in the Supreme Court only covers pork, which will go into effect in five months.\n\nSee also this question on Metaculus: \n\n(https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/embed\/11624\/)I will likely resolve according to however Metaculus decides this question, unless anyone presents a better-specified resolution criteria.\n\n\nClose date updated to 2023-12-26 11:59 pm\n[Market creator] Austin\n[Creation date] 10-20-2022\n[Closing data] 05-11-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will vegan pizza be commonly available at one of the big four pizza chains in the US by the end of 2024?\n[Market description] Will any of the four big chains carry a pizza with vegan crust, sauce, and cheese available in most of their locations by the end of December 2024? \n\nThe big four chains are currently Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, and Papa John's; if a new pizza place knocks one of these out of the top four, the new chain will be eligible to resolve this as YES if it offers an eligible pizza. \n[Market creator] Duncn\n[Creation date] 09-20-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2025\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Just in case anyone was wondering, for the purposes of this market, what the four big chains carry is pizza.

However, I hadn't considered the possibility of a chain saying \"we're doing this for two weeks, then it goes away\"; that seems very low-probability, since you can't get new vegan customers to stick around if you take away the vegan option.  I \/think\/ I should count a New Year's Special vegan pizza as a valid YES resolution, although a very unlikely edge case. I am open to thoughts on this; the spirit of the question is that I, you, or pretty much anyone else (in the USA) should be able to access the pizza in question, and if it's available for just one day, that's a pretty limited interpretation of commonly available. But at the same time, the question does specify \"by the end of 2024\", and New Year's Eve is a reasonable interpretation of \"by the end of 2024\".

That said, it does look like the carton shortage probably counts. It looks like one of the major manufacturers fell short on supply, impacting multiple states, and other suppliers have not been able to pick up the slack and are no longer taking new orders. There is the wrinkle that we have a previous clarification (in the thread below) this that components of consumer goods do not count if the shortage does not result in a shortage of consumer goods; and the cartoon shortage does limit the distribution of milk, but arguably does not result in a shortage of milk. However, given that a large part of the role of milk in our society is to provide government subsidies to dairy farmers, and this significantly restricts that, I would accept it. (Or to put it another way, the major consumer of tiny milk cartons is the government, and they will not shift to gallon jugs; the market is not satisfied with the available supply chain).

If anyone feels that I've missed any, please let me know! \n---\n[Date]: 01-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I believe the egg shortage qualifies; however, the industry has managed demand by raising prices, so you can usually still buy eggs at most grocery stores, if you're willing to pay the price. This has resulted in most news outlets reporting on the cost of eggs, rather than the egg shortage. I am currently counting this as 1\/5 of the resolution criteria; if anyone objects, make your arguments now. \n---\n[Date]: 12-22-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  ... and done.\n---\n[Date]: 12-22-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  It is editable, and I will edit it. \n---\n[Date]: 12-22-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I agree, and moreover, if stories about chip shortages list multiple consumer products that are in short supply due to the chip shortage, that probably counts towards multiple of the five items. \n---\n[Date]: 12-22-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yes; a shortage of cars due to a shortage of chips would count; a shortage of computer chips that did not result in any downstream shortages.... is not a true shortage?

This market resolves to the 10% (rounded up) of proposed names that we like the best. Proposed answers that are not names will not be considered.\n\nClose spelling variations that do not change pronunciation (in my opinion) will only be considered once, with preference given to the first-submitted option. (Consider an example where there are 25 options submitted, including Aiden, Aden, Aidan, Michael, Mikhail and 20 others. Aiden, Aden and Aidan count once, while Michael and Mikhail are pronounced differently so they count separately. That leaves 23 names considered, of which we will choose 3 names to resolve to (10%, 2.3, rounded up to 3).)\n\n\nSome factors that might influence our decision:\n\n-An ultrasound on week 20 identified the baby as a boy, and we are planning to choose a name that is either gender-neutral or typically given to boys.\n\n-We are moderately contrarian--we are less likely to choose an extremely common name, but we do not plan on inventing a new name.\n-Names shared by nerds\/scientists\/astronauts\/etc are more likely to be chosen than names shared by sportsballers\/politicians\/actors\/etc. \n\n-Our heritage is American, Canadian, German and Scottish, and we are more likely to choose a name linked to one of those cultures.\n-We are open to considering arguments in the comments challenging any of the above.\n\n-I have promised to choose a name that my mother will be able to pronounce.\n\nI will not vote in this market, aside from the mana already placed on the \"Cornelius\" answer. I commit to not selling that position, and I commit to not resolving to that answer. That mana is a subsidy provided to the market, since there does not seem to be a \"subsidize\" button for free response markets as there is for yes\/no markets.\n\nClose date updated to 2023-02-13 11:59 pm\n[Market creator] Cornelius Grass\n[Creation date] 01-18-2023\n[Closing data] 02-14-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: 64 total names, thank you everyone! 10% rounded up is 7 names: Nicholas, Elliott, Finlay, Finn, Theodore, Luther and Valen.\n---\n[Date]: 02-14-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Now that those are out, that seems like it might make sense, but the timing didn't quite work.

My prediction for the market: On the first few days, trading will be a little bit chaotic and there will be some arbitrage opportunities. A few days will pass. In this time period, your ideal strategy would be to buy shares of one option if it strays significantly below 33%, then sell when the option rises to about 33%. Thus, I think the market will settle into a near-equilibrium. Then, the market on the last day will return to chaos. Let's say you have a large volume of Option A shares, and A\/B\/C is at 34\/33\/33%. Now, your optimal strategy would probably be to put a little bit of money in B and C or sell some A shares in order to make A the lowest option.

If such a detonation occurs, resolves YES if within one year, any strategic nuclear weapon is detonated (that includes the case if the first detonation is strategic). Resolves NO otherwise.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, a strategic nuclear weapon is a weapon designed mostly to be targeted at the enemy interior (away from the war front) against military bases, cities, towns, arms industries, and other hardened or larger-area targets, while a non-strategic nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon designed mostly to be used on a battlefield, near friendly forces, or on or near friendly territory. There is no exact definition on weapon yields or ranges. But note that this question is about the type of weapon, not the type of target; it's conceivable that a non-strategic weapon could be used against the sort of target strategic weapons are designed for or vice versa.\n\nOffensively means neither detonations for testing purposes nor peaceful nuclear explosions will count towards question resolution, even if such detonations cause substantial damage.\n\nThe detonation does not need to be deliberate to count towards question resolution - an inadvertent, accidental, or unauthorized detonation can count.\n\nI will use Metaculus decisions on https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/8584\/nsnw-as-the-first-nuclear-detonation-by-2024\/ and related questions to determine whether a nuclear weapon detonation counts as offensive, and whether it counts as strategic.\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 10-04-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will North Korea detonate a nuclear weapon by June 9, 2023?

NO otherwise.\n\nResolution will be based on reliable media reporting.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2022, North Korea conducted a large number of ballistic missile tests and announced their intent to expand their nuclear arsenal. North Korea has done 6 nuclear tests (see Wikipedia's list here), the first in 2006 and the most recent in 2017.

If a nuclear weapon were launched or dropped but the nuclear weapon did not detonate (due to malfunction, interception, etc), that would not count as detonation. If a conventional explosion occurs but no nuclear explosion (for example, a dirty bomb that distributes radioactive material with a conventional explosion), that does not count.\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 01-07-2023\n[Closing data] 06-11-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: GJO  is now predicting 33% - a slight uptick in recent weeks after the recent NK ICBM tests\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Sorry, it's at 42%\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Good Judgement Open is at 36% https:\/\/www.gjopen.com\/questions\/2659-between-9-december-2022-and-9-june-2023-will-north-korea-detonate-a-nuclear-device\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: https:\/\/www.koreaherald.com\/view.php?ud=20230202000735\n","[Market title] If North Korea conducts a nuclear weapon test in 2022, will there be a deadly military conflict between North and South Korean forces by February 2023?\n[Market description] This question will resolve as N\/A if North Korea does not conduct a nuclear weapon test by the end of 2022, as per the question Will North Korea conduct a nuclear weapons test in 2022?\n\nIf North Korea does perform a nuclear weapon test, resolves YES if by the end of February 2023, kinetic military action takes place between North Korean and South Korean forces, causing at least 1 fatality.

Does the photo have to be undetectable as AI-generated?\n\nNo, if the photo is perfectly believable on casual inspection but can be determined to be AI-generated with some forensics, that still counts as YES. \n\nOf course detecting that the image is fake via real-world knowledge -- like knowing things about the human test subjects or just knowing that the depicted scene is fantastical -- isn't grounds for resolving NO.\n\n2. How well does it have to understand the text descriptions?\n\nMuch better than 2022 DALL-E but it doesn't have to be quite human-level. If you have to work to find convoluted descriptions that confuse it, that still counts as YES. If there are perfectly clear descriptions that you can't get it to understand even with multiple rephrasings, that's a NO.\n\n3. Does it have to be able to generate deepfakes of anyone?\n\nYes, if it can only do public figures or any fixed database of people, that doesn't count. To resolve YES it needs to work for anyone you provide sample images of. Even people who do not exist.\n\n4. Does it have to be available to anyone?\n\nYes, if OpenAI or Google or such demonstrate the ability but there's no reasonable way for outsiders to try it, this resolves NO. This matters because the question isn't just about the cutting edge of the technology but also how impactful\/dangerous it will be.\n\nAnd we're using $100 as the threshold for how much time\/cost it can take for an outsider to get an image like this generated and still count as \"available to anyone\".\n\n5. Any constraints on the sample images?\n\nIf it required a massive number of sample images or the sample images had to be taken with special equipment, like doing a 3D body or face scan or something, that starts to go outside the spirit of the question. But of course it's fine for the AI to make up any details about the subjects that are impossible to tell from the sample images. \n\nThe rule of thumb is that someone judging the deepfake, who only knows the subjects from the same sample images the AI saw, would not be immediately suspicious that the generated image was fake. (Unless the image was depicting something fantastical. You get the idea.)\n\n6. How instant does it have to be?\n\nOne hour. The \"instant\" in the title is more about being on-demand and fully automated than about exactly how long the image takes to generate.\n\n7. Does it have to nail it on the first try?\n\nNo, as William Ehlhardt points out, there's a beyond-astronomical space of possible images so the ability to generate, say, one in a hundred that match the prompt isn't very much less gobsmacking than the ability to do it on the first try. The AI is still meaningfully succeeding at the task. We'll go with best-of-ten when resolving this market.\n\n8. Does it have to be able to do NSFW photos?\n\nNo, if it has filters that prevent it from generating reasonably narrow\/specific categories of images such as NSFW, that doesn't prevent this from resolving YES. PS: I forgot that a year ago in the comments here I'd already clarified this thusly: Applying normal content filtering is fine as long as it isn't somehow so broad that it covers up an inability to handle arbitrary descriptions.\n\nAI Bulls vs AI Bears\n\nThis market is another possible operationalization of the disagreement between what I'll call the AI Bulls and the AI Bears. The bulls believe, for example, that \"scale is all you need\". That we're on a trajectory towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and that it will emerge automatically by scaling up existing neural net architectures. If you believe that it's scale plus a handful of additional breakthroughs that the time is ripe for, that still puts you pretty far towards the bull end of the bear-bull spectrum. The AI bears, such as Gary Marcus, believe that recent leaps in capability and seeming-understanding shown by DALL-E and GPT and the like are going to hit another wall before reaching human level and that AGI is thus still decades away.\n\nNote that the bear-bull spectrum is orthogonal to the spectrum of beliefs about how hard AI alignment is. For example, an AI bear may agree that if we did somehow hit upon AGI in a few years, that would literally destroy humanity. Likewise, some AI bulls believe that AI doom is nigh and others believe that AI utopia is nigh.\n\nRelated Markets\n\nSame prediction but by end of 2024\n\nWhether DALLE-3 will be able to do \"blue grass, green sky\"\n\nAnother DALLE-3 \"blue grass, green sky\" market (maybe with stricter criteria?)\n[Market creator] Daniel Reeves\n[Creation date] 12-07-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2028\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I got an interesting comment on this offline, saying that for the deepfake aspect -- as in generating novel images that look like real photos of a specific person -- we're basically there with 10-15 sample images and a LoRA. We're much less close on \"synthesize basically any image\" part. Also inpainting makes a huge difference. Which has me thinking that we should clarify whether any back-and-forth is allowed with the human who's specifying the image. Do you have to feed the system the sample images and the prompt and take the best of what it gives you in one shot? Or can you guide it with some back-and-forth, either with words or by indicating specific parts of the image that need to change? By default I think it has to be fully automated and one-shot but if anyone feels that's overly strict, let's discuss! There may be clarifications we can add to allow for flexibility on this without violating the existing clarifications.\n---\n[Date]: 11-15-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Great clarification.

I think we can factor out the need for reference photos of artifacts by dropping the head-to-head comparison. So we need to feed that description to the image generator, then show only the deepfake to people and ask them if it's a real photo of the described scenario. If most people say it's real or even that they can't tell for sure if it's real, that's a YES. We can stipulate that we pose the question in such a way that when the photo really is real, everyone agrees about it at least being not-obviously-fake. PS: We can disqualify people, for example, for knowing better what a Tour de France bike looks like than a lay person, or we can let the \"most people\" clause cover that. But this is just the original stipulation that it doesn't count to identify the deepfake based on special knowledge.\n---\n[Date]: 08-19-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Are we agreed that for this to resolve YES, we'll need to be able to put together a ridiculous scene like the following, both for real and as a deepfake, generated only from this description, and then show them to people and have it not be obvious which version is the real one? \"Me and Ryan Gosling staring lovingly into each other's eyes.

Let me add a note to the description to say that I'm doing everything I can to make the resolution criteria as objective as they can be but also that I'm trading in the market myself. From what I've gleaned from all the debates about the norms around creators trading in their own markets, the founders don't want to discourage it because often the creator is the person who cares most about the question or has the most information to help the market price converge to the truth. Those are the norms I personally favor: even insider trading is explicitly a good thing because it promotes greater accuracy of the markets. (or maybe most saliently: discouraging creators from trading would mean fewer markets created. and\/or might encourage sockpuppetry?) In any case, please do ask more clarifying questions you can think of. I think the ones we have so far make it reasonably unlikely that we'll find ourselves in a confusing gray area at the end of 2027. But if we do, I promise to do my best to gather input and resolve as close to the spirit of the prediction as possible. I'm also happy to be totally transparent about my own thinking when betting NO on this. Right now it's based on seeing how clueless the state-of-the-art image generators are at composing different aspects of prompts with more than a couple elements to them. (Search \"basketball\" in the comments below for an example.)\n---\n[Date]: 05-16-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:    Well this is getting exciting. To reiterate from other comments, current DALL-E and Midjourney really fall on their faces trying to compose even a few different elements. And consider some other hurdles from the FAQ in the market description here: It all sounds like a lot to me! Of course all of the above is not as gobsmacking as what diffusion models suddenly became capable of in the last couple years.

But I think there are multiple hurdles that will take some time. For example, what do you get if you ask for the pope wearing a white puffer jacket sitting on a basketball and holding a melty ice cream cone? I'm guessing it doesn't understand how to compose those different things?

For defining \"instant\" (thanks again for identifying these ambiguities!) I wouldn't feel great about resolving NO if this worked fine but took a few minutes to generate. So I propose a 1-hour threshold as still counting as relatively instant. What I really meant by instant was on-demand, fully automated, not so much about the exact amount of time it takes.

I agree that was not an ideal system, and I'm glad we now have a better multiple-choice structure for questions like these. This is a recurring problem on Manifold. Someone will do something weird and experimental, like this market, relying on the serious users to understand the dynamics at play. But the newer and less frequent users may misunderstand what's going on and lose mana on it, which is bad for popularization and mass-market appeal. Maybe we should have a \"power user only\" tag for markets, and hide any market with that tag from people who haven't opted into it? Would include both experimental new things and also older features that were grandfathered in, like numeric and DPM markets.\n---\n[Date]: 10-20-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Oh, because Manifold's UI for resolving multiple-choice markets is terrible.

The key issue is that normally if someone asks a question like \"Will this market have >100k total bet on it by 10\/31\" it is implicit that the market remains open for the duration. Authors could abuse it just closing the market whenever they feel like to force a NO resolution, but that would be considered a trick. Spindle could also have closed down the market and waited to resolve no on 10\/31, and that would have also violated the traders' reasonable expectations. Also, this is not an attack on Spindle, I'm just trying to decide how to resolve this meta-market. I think it was a fun trick market, and the fact that Spindle creates trick markets is something traders can take into account when looking at future markets. As has been said before, deciding whether a market was improperly resolved is not necessarily a statement about whether it was morally bad, just a statement about what traders should have expected and whether they should be wary of potential misresolutions in the future.\n---\n[Date]: 09-16-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Right.

Spindle resolved it early, which ensured that the answer would be NO. However, the answer only became a certain NO  because  Spindle resolved NO - it's not true that the answer was determined, and then Spindle resolved it. So currently I consider it improper or dubious at least. Also, more important than the technicalities is the motivating question of whether it's what a reasonable bettor would have expected. I think no.\n---\n[Date]: 09-08-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yep, thanks for adding it, that definitely counts as incorrect resolution as per Austin's comment  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/Austin\/what-contributions-will-we-list-on#Df3a0jEtLDQ9qEJKQO1Y\n---\n[Date]: 09-08-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: It seems like Manifold is converging on 30 days without an author response as a reasonable deadline (it's now in the community guidelines). I also agree that for typical cases of the author disappearing for example, that's quite  reasonable.

If it's simply forgotten about, and nobody reminded the author, I might not count that at all. But if it continued to be abandoned after reminders for no good reason for say a few weeks, that would probably count. (Btw, there really should be a better system to remind the author to resolve.) If it was because the market takes a lot of fact-finding to figure out the correct resolution, that in theory could have happened sooner but the author was busy, I think I probably would excuse even longer delays. Any amount of delay for what I think of as an improper reason would cause me to count it here. DrP's market  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/DrP\/will-donald-j-trump-be-the-presiden  I count as improper, because their stated reason is pretty clearly a flimsy cover for trolling the market participants.\n---\n[Date]: 08-31-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Not actually a paradox :) I don't think this will happen, but there's some chance I will judge myself to be unable to resolve this market correctly and fairly, in which case it's possible I'd include this option.\n","[Market title] Will Biden still be president at the end of October 2022? (resolves to quiescent market price)\n[Market description] In case you missed it, there've been some fascinating experiments with self-resolving markets on Manifold lately. The idea of a self-resolving market is that sometimes it's hard or impossible to pin down unambiguous resolution criteria for a prediction. In that case resolving to the consensus of the market participants may make sense. And from a prediction market perspective, the obvious way to define \"the consensus of the participants\" is the market price. See also Keynesian beauty contests. It's weirdly self-referential but maybe there are conditions in which we expect it to work?\n\nWe've seen one spectacular failure -- https:\/\/manifold.markets\/jack\/will-biden-be-president-on-915-reso -- in which an exciting tug-o-war was waged that had little connection to what the market was purportedly predicting.\n\nBut I conjecture that that was mostly about the hard(ish) end date. In setting up the experiment we knew that a known end date opens the market up to price manipulation at the last second and we tried to mitigate that with a random close time, but it was a random close time within a small window. It was still possible to temporarily manipulate the price for profit.\n\nSo this is an experiment to see how close we get to the truth if the market self-resolves as follows:\n\nThe market won't close before the end of October (when the true outcome is known).\n\nThe market will then stay open until the market price fully quiesces, meaning it stays the same (to the nearest whole percent) for two business days in a row. The market then resolves to that price.\n\nBut if a market participant wants to go on vacation or something, they can just ask in the comments to not let the market close before they return. We want to only resolve to a genuine consensus probability.\n\nIf we go all the way [through] November without the market stabilizing then it resolves N\/A. That would be a shame but not necessarily bad, in general, in terms of the market price being informative, if it's oscillating around some estimate of the underlying truth.\n\nPoint 3 might be silly and unscalable, I'm not sure. It's an experiment. But if it did make sense, one can imagine ways to make it scale to larger markets. The answer might be to stick to a strict definition of quiescence and traders can just use trading bots or limit orders while they're away. (Or we could just say that checking in every other business day isn't that onerous, suck it up.)\n\nPoint 4 may open up an unfortunate loophole in that a participant can force the price to oscillate if they don't like the outcome. I think liquidity fees could solve that (which may be important anyway, since it's a very valuable property of markets that liquidity increases with trading volume!) because then it would get more and more expensive to keep the price oscillating. For this experiment, we'll just take the risk that that happens. Since everyone gets their money back in that case, the risk is arguably not so bad.\n\n\nUPDATE: From the comments, pinning down the criteria for quiescence:\n\nIf the market price stays the same or oscillates between consecutive integer percents from noon pacific to noon pacific two business days later (so at least 48 hours, longer over weekends and holidays) then that counts as the market quiescing. I plan to add comments warning us as we approach the end of the window and plan to say yes to requests to temporarily lengthen the window (assuming they're based on real-world reasons like vacations).\n\n\nPS: The official Schelling Point is 95%. Or oscillating between 94% and 95%.\n[Market creator] Daniel Reeves\n[Creation date] 10-02-2022\n[Closing data] 11-28-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-28-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Well that was exciting! Huge thanks to   who did almost all the work in preventing the manipulators from getting the market to resolve at 40%! But also kudos to the manipulators -- mainly   -- who proved the point that this variant does not in fact fix the problem in the previous auto-resolve-with-quiescence experiment.  For the question of whether one more patch could work, where the quiescence criteria are hypersensitive so the market only resolves if everyone agrees, @jack has convinced me it doesn't work. It might happen to work for dummy questions like Biden being president but all of this only matters for real questions with real disagreement and that means hypersensitive quiescence criteria just guarantees no quiescence. Disagreement means pulling the price in different directions, after all. So if it's very predictable that the market will resolve N\/A then people won't invest resources to make the price be right, whatever they think \"right\" means. That defeats the point of the prediction market. Removing the incentive for manipulation in an auto-resolving market also removes the incentive to make the market reflect the truth. I'm not fully convinced of that -- maybe there are real-world conditions in which the chances of manipulation are plenty low -- but, well, this experiment (and especially discussions with @jack about it) increased my understanding of the limitations by a lot.

In the final quiescence period (noon PST Monday to noon PST Wednesday) anyone who would lose mana if the market resolves to PROB at 50% (including me, big time) might as well dump all their mana on YES. Either we succeed in pushing the price to 52% and the market resolves N\/A and we all get all our money back, or we fail to break through the limit order and the shares we buy in that period cash out at the same price we bought them at. To repeat, if you don't want the market to resolve to PROB at 50%, dump all your mana on YES starting at noon PST on Monday.

Feel free to try a version that stays open however long it takes to quiesce. I think with liquidity fees, that would work. Eventually it would get too expensive to keep playing tug-o-war. Without liquidity fees, as in this market, it's plausible that the tug-o-war could go for ... years? I don't know. If Manifold's loan feature were more expensive that's another way that an indefinite tug-o-war could eventually get too expensive for traders to sustain. Musing: If we do find some variant of auto-resolution that actually works, even if it involves a painfully long quiescence period, that may imply a version that works with a non-painful quiescence period. Because traders would do the backward induction and not get in these dumb tug-o-wars in the first place and the market might actually just converge to the Schelling point?

What if I add a \"going once... going twice...\" comment when we seem to have stabilized to help ensure that anyone checking in on the market every other business day will have time to react? My sense is that pinning down the exact definition of quiescence isn't important. Just check in every weekday and you'll definitely be fine -- how much grace period we want beyond that can be a bit fuzzy. Unless there's potential unfairness here I'm not appreciating? If you move the price at noon on Monday and then Thursday night someone finally gets around to moving it back, are you going to be miffed cuz it should've been declared quiescent by then? Or is it fine cuz the point is true quiescence and it obviously wasn't truly quiescent if someone still wanted to move the price? In any case, might as well pin it down, so here's my proposal to operationalize what I originally said: If the market price stays the same or oscillates between consecutive integer percents from noon pacific to noon pacific two business days later (so at least 48 hours, longer over weekends and holidays) then that counts as the market quiescing.

Recently, the Ukrainian FM Kuleba stated that \"Russia must face a war-crimes tribunal before his country directly talks with Moscow\", something Russia will certainly not agree to. On the other side, Russia has had a remarkably consistent position since the breakdown of the first stage of peace talks in late March: It says it's prepared to hold peace talks at any moment, Ukraine just has to accept some preliminaries, which, if you read them, more or less boil down to surrender. That's certainly not something Ukraine will agree to. So, at the moment, I don't see any interest in negotiations on either side. However, six months are quite a bit of time, and significant military successes for Ukraine, internal troubles or issues with Putin's health could bring changes about in Russia. In Ukraine, I think the most likely (though not necessarily likely in absolute terms) factor might be a significant deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Some of those can cause the sides to drop their maximum demands (which are presumably meant as bargaining chips) and seriously consider negotiations.

For example, in this case the more intuitive statement of the question might be \"Will Russia have clearly established control of the Bakhmut train station by April 20?\" - the \"clearly established\" part helps reflect how ISW does their mapmaking. But I suspect people would prefer to predict a question that doesn't hinge on the \"clearly established\" part (which could be easily done by using the orange shaded region, or using a different map). Then the question is more like, \"Will Russia appear to have control of the train station?\" But do note that such a question could also have come down to the wire, and seen lots of disagreements between different maps, if the deadline was about a week earlier.  That's an option but I'm not a fan of that, I'd rather just ask whether ISW will shade the location either red or orange.\n---\n[Date]: 04-21-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I'm planning to create some more markets similar to this.

As an example, here is a detailed thread by one of the map authors showing how this is done for one day's updates:  https:\/\/twitter.com\/georgewbarros\/status\/1643403932276858880 . Because it moves only after verification based on visual evidence, the red shading is a relatively more conservative and reliable indicator of Russian control compared to the yellow shading and to some other maps, especially in contested areas. It may sometimes tend to lag some days behind other maps, depending on the speed at which visual evidence becomes available. In Bakhmut, advances in the red shading have often been several days behind the yellow shading and other maps. On the other hand, for an example where it updated quickly, after Ukraine retook Kherson, ISW's maps were updated  within a day  because of the plentiful visual evidence available. So when an area becomes shaded red on ISW's maps, it means we can be highly confident that Russia has advanced there, whereas on other maps it may represent a lower level of confidence. This has obvious pros and cons (confidence vs latency of updates), just be aware of it when interpreting the maps. The maps are updated at 3pm ET every day, and the conflict updates are published later that day with the same maps (note that they also say \"Assessed Control ... as of 3:00 PM ET\"). I.e. the historical maps for each day are available in those conflict updates. This is very helpful for using it as a resolution source, compared to other maps which update live and don't necessarily have an easily accessible historical archive.\n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  You are correct, ISW is updating the maps every day.

A 300k grant would have represented a significant chunk of our budget, but a loan is something we can make with much less analysis, esp given that we were possibly going to park our ~2.2m cash balance in a high yield treasury account anyways\n\nI didn't think very deeply wrt interest rate; originally offered interest-free, before realizing that we'd be losing out on baseline yield; 1% for 2 months felt roughly reasonable. The core motive was more \"help out an org we think does great work\" as opposed to \"purely profit seeking\".\n\nStephen informs me the market rate for a loan like this might be 15% annualized, in which case I'd view the difference between market rate and what we offered (~2.5% - 1% over 2 months on 300k = 4.5k) to be a donation to Lightcone\n\nConflict of interest notes: Manifold is discussing running a forecasting conference at Rose Garden Inn sometime around Sep 2023; we'd expect to pay for the use of the venue.\n[Market creator] Austin\n[Creation date] 06-23-2023\n[Closing data] 08-19-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-15-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  as mentioned in the description, I would have allowed about a week for payment processing to clear past market close.

So, let's put it to the market!\n\n\"Betting Streaks\": Give users M$5 for betting on day 1 of a streak, then M$10 on day 2, M$15 on day 3, etc. while the streak remains unbroken. Maybe capped at M$25 or something.\n\n\"Market of the Day\": Highlight a single market each day, eg pinned to the top on the home feed, where we encourage most Manifold users to bet along. Ideally the market resolves the next day, to give traders fast feedback.\n\nHow this market will be resolved:\n\nAnyone can leave a comment with a score\/10, judging how good they think the feature was at improving our retention and DAU. E.g. \"[JUDGE] Streak: 5\/10; MotD: 8\/10\"\n\nManifold core team scores count 3x\n\nYou can update your decision; your last score before market close is the one that will be counted\n\nAt market resolution, the sum of the scores determines how this market resolves.\n\nResolves to N\/A if both features are not implemented by market close.\n\nAug 20, 11:28am: To calibrate your judging, this is what I had in mind:\n\n\n0\/10: This feature singlehandedly caused our entire userbase to churn\n\n2\/10: This feature was ultimately a waste of time, we've taken it out\n\n5\/10: This feature was basically neutral; if could flip a coin between having and not having this feature, I would be completely ambivalent.\n\n8\/10: Very happy we did this feature, no one's even considering removing it now\n\n10\/10: This feature singlehandedly gets us to hockey-stick product market fit\n\nMy personal impressions on a variety of recent initiatives, at this point in time:\n\nChallenge Bets: 3\/10\n\nGroups: 4\/10\n\nMultiple Choice Markets: 4\/10\n\nLimit Orders: 5\/10\n\nReferrals: 6\/10\n\nRich Text Editor: 7\/10\n\nSalem Center Tournament: 7\/10\n\nUnique Trader Bonus: 8\/10\n[Market creator] Austin\n[Creation date] 08-17-2022\n[Closing data] 10-25-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 10-27-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  fwiw I've stopped paying attention to streaks altogether after the first time I broke them\n---\n[Date]: 10-26-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Thanks everyone for participating! Really enjoyed the discussion and voting on this market, and I hope to run more experiments like this. I'm definitely getting the message that \"betting streaks are popular\", though I'm still not sure that I would include it in Manifold if it were solely up to me. At this point in time, I'd rate streaks as 5\/10 and Market of the Day at 3\/10; I think the potential on MotD is still there, but there wasn't much in the way of execution (and it's worth noting that getting to a good execution might have taken a lot more work, which is a point against it).\n---\n[Date]: 09-20-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Thanks for this compilation!

This market will close as soon as any of the streak counts falls below 10. In case of a draw (two or more people break their streak at the same day) a separate script will be run to determine for which user the stretch of time between their latest bet and the moment their streak was broken is the longest.

Although I might make a market \"Who will lose a Forgiveness point first?\" tomorrow. I bet it'll be much more chaotic and eventful. But the set of 20 people will be slightly different, to select for \"record breaking forgiveness point count\" owners.\n---\n[Date]: 05-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Oh, by the way, this \"minimum wait time\" makes it  harder  to intentionally trigger this market's resolution. Because a person determined to break their streak would have to take a forgiveness-point number of days away from Manifold. Which might be hard, and not worth the profit here.\n---\n[Date]: 05-19-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  yes,   got 2 \"streak forgiveness points\" subtracted for those 2 days he skipped, now he has 4 left.  In total 6 points (1 per every month since Dec 2022) were given to all 20 people mentioned in this market, and the number of those points has to fall to 0, before the streak is broken and reset to 0. So the wait time between somebody becoming inactive on Manifold and this market resolving will currently be at most 6 days. The core problem here is that those points accumulate. So, in theory, some of the people in this market might end up with 13 forgiveness points on Jan 1st 2024, and then take a ~2 week break from Manifold, and their streak will still be unbroken when they return. This logic feels wrong. Such a long break no longer feels   as streak. So I might advocate for capping forgiveness points to 3, in the  #dev-and-api  channel on Discord.

(Sponsored by Wobbles)\n[Market description] This will be the central location for tournament info. See also the #mtg-tournaments channel in the Manifold Discord server. All markets about this tournament can go into the February MTG tournament group.\n\nWe have 16 competitors. We're going to be running this as a traditional Swiss tournament of 5 rounds, followed by a cut to top 4 single elimination. The prize payout is:\n\n1st place: M$2000\n\n2nd place: M$1400\n\n3rd and 4th place: M$650 each\n\n5th through 8th place: M$100 each\n\nYour deck must be one of the 15 provided intro decks. (5 monocolor and 10 bicolor.) Please make sure you're using the Alchemy versions and not the Standard versions. You may swap decks in between rounds, but must use the same deck for all games of a single match. You also can't swap decks in the top 4, so the finals match must be played with the same deck you used in the semifinals.\n\nAll the normal rules about money and match result determination do not apply to this tournament. You can wager on the matches, bribe your opponent, bet against yourself and then concede, etc. The only rule is that you must be honest about what you did afterwards, so we can decide whether this is a good idea for future tournaments. Any wagers\/bribes should occur only in mana, favors, or other items of non-monetary value. No real money.\n\nI strongly recommend that you stream your match in the Manifold discord voice channel, or some other streaming platform. (Discord is very easy to stream to, it's all built in. Just join the voice channel and click the \"go live\" button.) This will let people spectate and place live bets on your games, which is more fun for everyone. Give people a heads up in discord and\/or the market a few hours in advance, so they know when to show up to spectate.\n\nSpectators should not provide gameplay advice to the players during a match, unless both players have indicated that they're ok with that. Players may not stream snipe their opponent. Looking at your opponent's decklist is allowed, even while the game is ongoing. (Decklists can be found here.) Looking up any other strategical information during the match is not allowed. (Looking up rules and card text is fine.) Betting in markets about your own match is allowed, even if seeing the current probability could give you some informantion about your opponent's hand. However, please don't read the comments or any Discord channels that may contain discussion about the match. The match should primarily be your skills and knowledge at play, not those of other people.\n\nNote that we're using the traditional best-of-3 tournament matches, not Arena's default best-of-1. When you go to create a challenge, use the match type selection box in the top right and choose \"Alchemy tournament match\". (Screenshot)\n\nFor simplicity and ease of locating information, please always report your match result on the market that I made about that match outcome, including who won with what score, and what decks both people were playing.\n\nYou can see the current standings and results here.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 03-01-2023\n[Closing data] 05-22-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Closing this now to prevent the issue with DPM markets when someone can pour arbitrary mana into the winning option once it's known.\n---\n[Date]: 03-28-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Wizards has apparently made some changes to the default decks that Arena provides.

Most of the action in the individual-match markets takes place within a few minutes while the match is being played.

Now it isn't. Part of that is the passage of time, of course, with newer things to talk about. But part of it is, it seems to me, that there has become a particular story that has been accepted, and now it's not worth arguing about anymore. This seems to have happened in something like a phase-change around June, which is evidence in favor of the crystallizing-consensus explanation over a passage-of-time explanation, which one would expect to be more continuous. In response to your specific scenario, I'd point out that of course there exist people who don't particularly care about the topic and thus don't know much about it, and thus don't have a strong opinion one way or another\u2014in fact almost everyone in the world is like that. Consensus  must  mean among people who have an actual opinion, who consider themselves informed on the matter and are willing to take a stance about the case. Yes, if everyone had thought about it deeply and reached an estimate of 55% that would be one thing; but if most people didn't think about it at all, maybe leaning one way some small amount (say 55%), but among those who actually cared about it most everyone estimated 90%, I'd call that consensus even if that later group is small. That said, all my evidence up until this point is just vibes and impressions. It would be nice to have something more quantitative, perhaps a poll of some sort. Or let's put it this way, given that all we need to prove for a N\/A resolution is that there isn't a consensus: if some number of credible people are willing to go on the record in this thread arguing a theory that states that a non-western aligned party was responsible, then that disproves the existence of consensus. Anyone who has such theories: post them here, with a short explanation of what you believe and what you think the evidence is, and create (and link to) a market in which people can bet on the correctness of your theory (or some proxy for it.) If this thread collects a number of such examples it will be clear there is no consensus. Even a handful of reasoned arguments for other theories would be enough. If we can't get anyone to take a solid stance for any opposing theory, that would, on the other hand, be evidence of consensus for YES. Is this satisfactory? I believe this cuts to the heart of the matter. The thing that would make me confident in consensus is if indeed no one is willing to commit to any opposing theory, and the thing that would make me confident in lack-of-consensus is if plenty of people showed up with confidence in other theories. Admittedly there is a gray space with subjectivity in between: e.g. if the only reply is a single drive-by comment saying \"I think Russia did it, lol\". There does need to be some weighting by effort here, I think. Still, I think this is an experiment that is worth doing. Feel free to invite others who you know have an opinion on the matter to engage in this way, or in any equivalent way that also demonstrates a similar stance, ideally with some form of skin in the game, be it mana or reputation staked on the outcome.\n---\n[Date]: 10-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Agreed. That aligns with my thoughts on what would be an proper resolution. The close date referred to in the description is the close date at the time\u2014changing (now) the close date wouldn't change what the description meant or means.\n---\n[Date]: 10-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Nothing is definitive, and maybe never will be. But at least among the people I've recently discussed the topic with it seems to be pretty settled, after the Washington Post story\u2014before that it was up in the air, but since then it's not really been argued about. But others may have different experiences, and my aim in leaving it unresolved for a few days is to have the opportunity to hear from others. Maybe I'm in a bubble and others will correct me. A secondary influence is that this market is at 92%. This isn't a self-resolving market, and I wouldn't want it to be one\u2014if this market was obviously wrong, I'd resolve it in the obviously correct way. But as things stand, market participants have as a whole expressed a pretty strong belief in which way this will turn out. That's not the same thing as a consensus, but it's in the same category of thing. Again, that's secondary\u2014if enough people credibly say that in their experience people are still arguing about it and there isn't a consensus, then I'll take that seriously (and resolve N\/A.)\n---\n[Date]: 10-02-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I actually agree with you that it would be better to extend the date and wait for more evidence or stronger consensus. That said, I feel bound by the initial description, which specified a resolution as of a specific date. Well, technically not. Rereading the description, I see it only says that it will close N\/A if there is no consensus by market close. Nevertheless, given the context, it's pretty clear that leaving it for longer wouldn't be in the spirit of the original description. So while I'm not happy about it, I feel the honorable thing to do would be to resolve it as well as is possible currently, i.e. to YES. I'm open to being persuaded otherwise.\n---\n[Date]: 10-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Seems to me like there is a consensus.

After expending so much effort to get Congress to formally endorse such visits to Taiwan, this is a dramatic change of tone from Taipei. Xi Jinping has, as of yesterday, shed all of the people holding him back from taking extremely bold actions. Yesterday's announcement of the brokered detente between the Saudis and Iranians was a geopolitical coup. Taiwan may actually be in play before the next US presidential election. I think I am changing my mind on a lot of things related to China after watching Xi at the most recent \"two sessions\" meeting. He had swagger. He was casually sipping tea while engaging in small talk with Wang Huning and Li Qiang. It's just - different.

Just politically speaking Nancy did it and the CCP was triggered hilariously so now every Speaker will do it for the foreseeable future or risk their party looking weaker than Nancy (they still are regardless) and the CCP looking like their flexing during her visit somehow influenced our support of Taiwan (it very much did not). Plus McCarthy was butt hurt Nancy didn't invite him and he has already promised not only to visit himself, but he wants to bring dozens of members of both parties with him.  Personally I think Apple should just buy TSMC and then the whole idea of who Taiwan belongs to is settled, it would be Tim Cook\u2019s.

This attempt aims to correct that. Thanks, Bolton, for the inspiration!\n\nThis market resolves to PROB=ROUND( x_(n+1), 2) i.e. the closest integer percent to x_(n+1) = (p+3) x_n (1-x_n), the (n+1)-th iteration of the logistic map's recurrence relation,\n\nwhere n = the number of unique traders at close (as seen in the market info pane accessible through the top-right [\u2022\u2022\u2022] button) and,\n\nthe initial iteration x_0 (read as x subindex zero) = p, the full-precision market probability value at close, as obtained through the API or anyone's web browser inspector (this is how I'll get it). Note this same p appears as part of the (p+3) parameter factor of the logistic map's recurrence above, limiting it within the region of the map shown here on the right of the red line:\n\n[image]I'm not sure how traders will try to figure this one out, but one thing I'm almost sure is, the higher the price and number of traders, the more chaotic (yet still deterministic) it should be.

I was dealing with some tough issues in the last few days, but let's keep this project going. If any reputable Manifold user would like to take over the process, I'd be interested to pass it on to someone else. Based on the poll results, I've decided to change the format of the playing card set to include 18 individuals (12 face cards, 4 Aces, and 2 jokers). To ensure that we have 4 female characters for the Queens, I'll make sure to select enough females to fill all of the Queen positions. The current list of users already secured a spot (9 in total): @IsaacKing   @jack   @Mira   @Botlab  (Michael's Bot Laboratory)  @Conflux   @BTE   @memestiny   @Spindle  @Wobbles   I've made some adjustment to the list of contenders for the remaining 9 positions: @Austin   @Catnee   @MarcusAbramovitch   @yaboi69   @jbeshir  (John Beshir) @EliezerYudkowsky       @MartinRandall levinafinkelstein   @Yev    (Olivia) I'll create a poll, and everyone is free to vote on it. The candidates with the most votes will get the remaining iconic user spots, although I will make some adjustments to ensure we have four female characters for the Queens positions.  Candidates with more votes will be given priority in choosing which cards they would like to be represented on.  Thank you everyone for your participation so far. May the most deserving candidate come out on top!\n---\n[Date]: 05-03-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I don't know if stocks are good at giving relative rankings between the individuals.

My understanding of the site norms (that I'm trying to follow) is to: - set clear resolution logic and date - strictly follow the rules that ate stated in description - not to change the description after people start betting.

Thank you! I was not thinking about such possibility. Creating markets is hard.  I was thinking how should I handle this possibility. At first I thought that in such case I should resolve it as n\/a, as this is an event that was not explicitly stated in the market description. But after thinking a bit more, I think that this is ok to resolve this market as NO if the summit is moved to some other country from  South Africa. My rationality about it that the needed country is explicitly stated in the market subject 'Will Vladimir Putin attend BRICS summit in South Africa in August?' and I'm not changing it. And this NO resolution plays well with the other NO resolutions already stated in the market description. So, in case the summit will be in August 2023, but it will be held in some other country (not in South Africa) I will resolve this market as NO (no matter if Vladimir Putin will attend it or not). I will add it do the ticket description.\n","[Market title] What will be the outcome of Putin's possible attendance at the BRICS summit?\n[Market description] Context:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-05-30\/south-africa-paves-way-for-immunity-for-brics-summit-attendees\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/1c8a6b2d-a190-46ec-90ad-fa3410998ae1\n\nSouth Africa has claimed it cannot arrest Vladimir Putin at a planned Brics summit in Johannesburg next month because Russia has threatened to \u201cdeclare war\u201d if the International Criminal Court warrant against its leader is enforced.\n\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said in court papers publicly released on Tuesday that \u201cRussia has made it clear that arresting its sitting president would be a declaration of war\u201d as he revealed that Pretoria has notified the ICC that it might not be able to detain Putin.\n\n\nPutin's acceptance of a South African invitation to appear alongside Chinese, Indian, Brazilian and other leaders of the so-called Brics nations at the summit has yet to be confirmed. Ramaphosa\u2019s government is increasingly anxious to dissuade him from coming given a looming clash with Pretoria\u2019s legal obligations. \n\n\u201cSouth Africa has obvious problems with executing a request to arrest and surrender President Putin\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it would be inconsistent with our constitution to risk engaging in war with Russia,\u201d Ramaphosa said. \n\nAs a member of the ICC, South Africa would risk breaking its own and international law if it sought to avoid arresting Putin, after the court indicted him on war crimes charges over child abductions in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThe Rome Statute treaty underpinning the ICC does allow states to consult the court if they encounter problems executing its warrants, the avenue South Africa is now using.

This market resolves to the rent we are charged for the month of September 2023.\n\nWe split rent payments evenly between us, but this resolves to the total rent we pay together, not the rent either one of us pays on our own. This does not count costs for utilities, security\/pet deposits, etc. - only rent.\n\nI'm cautious - arguably even paranoid - about giving out too much identifiable personal information on highly politically charged sites like Manifold, especially as a trans woman, so I'd rather not state the specific city we'll be moving to. I will state that rent prices are stupidly high there, and that the rent we pay for a pet-friendly one-bedroom apartment will almost certainly fall within the $1,250 to $1,850 range. In the (presumably unlikely) event that we're charged anything other than an even dollar amount (e.g. if we're charged $1X99.50), I'll round to the nearest dollar.\n\nI will not bet on this market, aside from some small bets (60 mana total) to set the starting probabilities. While my partner and I will have an apartment found well in advance of September, this market won't actually close and resolve until we have fully paid the first month's rent, likely at some point in the final week of August.

So obviously, I have to see how it would play out if it really was based on the geometric mean.\n\nThis market will resolve YES if the time-weighted geometric mean of its probability is greater than 1\/e \u2248 0.36788 after it closes. I will be using the exact probabilities, not the rounded values displayed by the market, since otherwise Team NO could easily win just by betting it down to 0.0% at any point in time. The value of 1\/e was chosen because it is the geometric mean of all values between 0 and 1, and therefore, it is theoretically the most fair value to use (using 1\/2 would give Team NO an advantage, since the geometric mean is smaller than the arithmetic mean). \n[Market creator] Plasma Ballin'\n[Creation date] 04-12-2023\n[Closing data] 05-02-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The final mean was 76.81%.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The current geometric mean is 74.8%, and Team NO would need the mean of the remaining time to be below 0.04% to win. \n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yeah, actually that's probably true. Even though the required percentage is slightly more extreme, the RMS market is probably easier to flip than this one given the lack of limit orders and fewer opponents. I still think the exponential mean would be harder to flip, though.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Funny that, until just now, this one was at the most extreme odds even though it's actually the easiest one to flip.

Some of the other suggested variants, like log-odds, would make it impossible for either team to be guaranteed victory, but this one only makes it impossible for YES to have a guarantee.\n---\n[Date]: 04-19-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Yeah, hence why I put a NO limit order there. I think the probability of YES winning is pretty high, given the current lead and the disadvantage that Team NO has as discussed below, but 90% does seem a bit more confident than is justified.\n---\n[Date]: 04-18-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Currently, I'm calculating a GM of 52%, well above the threshold for YES to win.\n---\n[Date]: 04-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I like your idea of using the ratio of the price of shares as way to quantify the difficulty of holding the market above or below a certain percentage. We can define DY(P)=P\/(1-P) as the difficulty for Team YES to hold the market at at least probability P, and likewise DN(P)=(1-P)\/P, with the absolute difficulty D(P) being defined as the maximum difficulty for either team. I can think of two ways to use this in an alternate version of this market:\n---\n[Date]: 04-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Hm, I was thinking that some common function like 6x(1-x) or \u03c0\/2*sin(\u03c0x) would make sense, but using the relative amounts that each side has to bet makes sense as well. Obviously, I am not going to change the resolution criteria of this market midway through, but it would be interesting to see a market with a higher threshold for YES to win.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Even though the value of 1\/e was originally chosen because it was theoretically the \"fair\" value, I actually think it gives a big advantage to Team YES. 1\/e is the geometric mean of all values between 0 and 1, but the market is much more likely to spend a lot of time around values in the middle than it is to spend time on the edges. So it probably would have been fairer (in the sense of making it equally easy for both sides to win) to take the geometric mean of some distribution with support in (0,1) and a mode of 1\/2. That would move the mean closer to 50%, though still below it.\n","[Market title] Will the average percent of this market be greater than a random number from 25 to 75?\n[Market description] Inspired by \"The Market\",  this market will be open for just over a week, until Sunday, April 23  7:30 PT. When it closes, I will calculate the average percentage that this market was at over the time period.  I will use displayed percentages, which are typically rounded to the nearest integer. [Clarification: When the percentage is below 2 or above 98, it is rounded to the nearest tenth instead.]\n\nAfter close of the market I will roll a random number based upon the total volume of the market using  @FairlyRandom.  The range can be as much as 50 \u00b1 25 or as little as 50 \u00b1 15 based upon the total market volume at close.\n\nFor a total market volume greater than 1,000,000 mana the random number range will be from 25 to 75.\n\nFor a total market volume less than or equal to 1,000,000 mana but greater than 100,000 the random number range will be from 30 to 70.\n\nFor a total market volume less than or equal to 100,000 the random number range will be from 35 to 65.\n\nResolves YES if this average is greater than number rolled, resolves NO if it's less than or equal to the number rolled. I may eyeball it if it's obvious who won, but I'll sift through timestamps or whatever's necessary in order to be sure I'm resolving correctly.\n\nFor most self-resolving markets, all that matters is the very end, so there's an incentive to act at the last moment, especially if it's close. For this one, every minute you're winning counts!\n\nIf @FairlyRandom is shown to be untrustworthy source of randomness then I will resolve with an assumed roll of 50, like \"The Market\"\n\n\n[Market creator] Wamba Ivanhoe\n[Creation date] 04-15-2023\n[Closing data] 04-24-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-24-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  well played to you as well sir.

I was thinking the graph made it look like the final average was above 50%, but actually, it's just showing the time the average flipped just before the end. I can see it more clearly on the even-more-zoomed-in version. I edited the original comment to correct my mistake.\n---\n[Date]: 05-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I made some visualizations of this market. Note that I only calculated the values at the times when trades were made, so the values of the averages, etc., at times between trades are not exact, they are just being linearly interpolated by Matplotlib. First, here is the graph of the average percentage over the whole time the market was open: It's hard to see most of it because of that spike at the beginning, so here's what it looks like with the beginning cut off: The final average was 49.99904%. The graph makes it look like it went above 50% at the very end, but actually that's showing what happened about 4 minutes before the end, where the average briefly flipped above 50%, only to go back down. Now, here's a graph of the average that would have been required to flip the Tekram at each point in time (That is, at time t, what would the average over all future times have to be for the final average to be exactly 50%?): Unsurprisiningly, it's pretty much just 50% for most of the time, though here's a zoomed in version of those earlier times: The final result wasn't determined until about 10 seconds before close. The final result for the unrounded average was determined earlier, about 21 minutes from close. But the results were opposites of each other. The rounded average crossed 50% ten different times, while the unrounded average crossed 50% five times.\n---\n[Date]: 04-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I didn't do the harmonic mean because the harmonic mean of [0,1] is 0, so it would be impossible for Team NO to win if I used the same method for determining the threshold they have to beat as I did in the other markets.

For most data types, you don't have to specify it because it defaults to zero, but there is no built-in default for the timedelta type, so I had to specify it myself. I tested on some data, but I don't have anyone else's script to compare it to. Also, I just found out that the \"Trades\" tab just ends after five pages and doesn't show the whole trade history.

The CCP is kinda absurd about titles. President doesn\u2019t automatically mean commander and chief of the military like it does in the US. In fact, the military is specifically under party control and in the case of war it is controlled by regional factional leaders, not central command or joint chiefs who report to Xi. Jiang Zemin maintained control of the military after leaving office and throughout his successor Hu Jintao\u2019s presidency despite being officially retired from political life.

When the government approaches the debt ceiling, it must either seek an increase in the limit from Congress or take measures to reduce its borrowing.\n\nIn the past, the U.S. has come close to breaching the debt ceiling on several occasions, and in some cases, the government has temporarily suspended the limit or taken other measures to avoid default.\n\nThe US has failed to pay debt obligations on time on several occasions. This Reason article describes five cases which could be characterized as default, and this Congressional Research Service (CRS) report explores three of them in more detail. The most recent occurrence was the 1979 \"mini-default\", when a technical error led to the late payment to holders of Treasury securities. CRS says the following about the overall record of US debt repayment:\n\nThe historical record appears not to support the contention that the U.S. government has had an unblemished payment record since its origin. Under any reasonable definition of default, the federal government defaulted in 1814. The Treasury Secretary of the time, Alexander Dallas, referred to \u201cevery sort of embarrassment.\u201d The current website of the U.S. Treasury notes that Secretary Dallas faced a \u201cbankrupt\u201d Treasury. The failure of the Treasury to pay interest on its securities due to Boston banks in 1814 represents an unambiguous default event.\n\nRegarding the 1979 \"mini-default\" CRS says:\n\nClaims that payment delays to small investors holding Treasury securities in the spring of 1979 constituted a default or a \u201ctechnical default\u201d appear weaker. Delays affected only a relatively small proportion of Treasury securities and the federal government responded to mitigate the inconvenience suffered by those investors. The legal document setting out terms for Treasury securities contained no default clause.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the deadline for a debt ceiling increase could come earlier than expected:\n\nThe U.S. government's deadline to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling could be sooner than expected, raising the prospect of a short-term debt limit extension, analysts said on Tuesday.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts said weak tax collections so far in April indicate a higher probability that the so-called \"X-date,\" when the government is no longer able to pay all its bills, would be reached in the first half of June. Analysts at Citi said they expected a short-term deal in June or July.\n\nThe Treasury Department has warned that the federal government could reach the moment when it will no longer be able to meet its financial obligations as early as June 5, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast that moment would come sometime between July and September.\n[Market creator] Metaculus Bot\n[Creation date] 04-25-2023\n[Closing data] 07-14-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will the US debt ceiling be raised by the end of June 2023?

Janet Yellen came out earlier in the week and said that the so called \"x date\" may be much earlier than previously thought - possibly as early as 1st June. That seemed to lead to an increase in the chances of an early raising of the debt ceiling, the probability of a rise by the end of May has risen to 27% from a low of about 15% earlier in the week. Does this mean that people think that Yellen is exaggerating but that her comments still mean that the x date is coming sooner than we thought? Meanwhile the probability of a chance of a raise by the end of June has risen to 75% from a low of around 50% The market now has a 90% expectation of a rise by the end of July, with very slightly higher probabilities for each month later in the year. So here are the odds for the four main scenarios when it comes to timing: Increase in May - 27% Increase in June - 48% Increase in July - 15% No increase by the end of July - 10%\n---\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  If they abolish the debt ceiling (even temporarily) so that the government can take on more debt than the current ceiling without the debt limit\/ceiling applying, it would resolve to YES I think that covers the kind of suspension that you're talking about, or did you mean something different?\n---\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: One of the main reasons why I set up these markets was to get a bit more context when reading articles like this: https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/05\/01\/biden-congress-debt-ceiling-meeting When news articles and commenters are talking about the urgency of getting something done in the next three or four weeks, it's useful to read it in the knowledge that the prediction market is suggesting that a raising of the ceiling is unlikely in May and there's a significant chance that it won't even be raised by the end of June!\n"],"150":["[Market title] Will Artemis I Launch by the end of September 2022?\n[Market description] Other Artermis 1 markets:\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Jonathanm\/will-artemis-i-launch-by-the-end-of)(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Yev\/will-artemis-i-launch-by-the-end-of-8abe031a54fa)(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Yev\/will-artemis-i-launch-by-the-end-of-75233245efeb)(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/grid\/will-nasas-artemis-i-launch-before\/will-nasas-artemis-i-launch-in-augu\/will-nasa-launch-artemis-1-by-the-e)Sep 15, 6:25pm: as with my previous Artemis market, I define \"launch\" as \"clears the launch tower during an intentional launch attempt\".

Xi Jinping is the one to propose, endorse, and enforce it. He had considered it his political feat. ( BBC report , NYT report ) I don't think you know how China works. CDC in China has no power or authority. Zero COVID is purely Xi's whim, as is now the easing of restrictions. There simply is no scientific support or basis whatsoever. None. Xi Jinping literally said on the 20th CCP National Congress (2022-10-16), \u6211\u5011\u5805\u6301\u4eba\u6c11\u81f3\u4e0a\u3001\u751f\u547d\u81f3\u4e0a\uff0c\u5805\u6301\u52d5\u614b\u6e05\u96f6\u4e0d\u52d5\u6416\uff0c\u958b\u5c55\u6297\u64ca\u75ab\u60c5\u4eba\u6c11\u6230\u722d\u3001\u7e3d\u9ad4\u6230\u3001\u963b\u64ca\u6230\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8b77\u4e86\u4eba\u6c11\u751f\u547d\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8eab\u9ad4\u5065\u5eb7 We upheld the supremacy of the people and of life, unwaveringly upheld Dynamic Zero COVID, and fought a war against the pandemic to protect the people's safety of life and health of body to the maximum degree. We  here refers to his party. The subject, the noun, in all paragraphs in the context is the party. Zero COVID  is a political term created by Xi's writers. The literal translation is 'clearing to zero'. \u52d5\u614b\u6e05\u96f6, Dynamic Zero COVID, lit. 'dynamic clearing', likewise invented by Xi's writers, means to lock down a city or community whenever there is one case of COVID. Xi's the one to come up with it, to propose it, to endorse it, and to enforce it. And Xi's writers came up with the name \u52d5\u614b\u6e05\u96f6 'dynamic clearing' Dynamic Zero COVID. The Zero COVID policy was quite whimsical, willful, and arbitrary. So was the sudden re-opening and easing of Zero COVID. Just a couple of weeks ago, Xi said on a meeting to uphold the Zero COVID policy! After the October CCP national congress. Yes. He FREQUENTLY mentioned and endorsed the Zero COVID policy. The question is, now Xi has abandoned what he endorsed and enforced for more than two years, will he as easily change his mind again, if cases are to increase at the current rate?\n","[Market title] Will China's Covid Zero policy end in November or December, 2022?\n[Market description] This question resolves to \"NO\" if China ends \"Covid Zero\" in October, or if the policy is still in place at the end of 2022.\n\nOct 15, 11:27pm: Will China's Covid Zero policy end in November or December, 2022? \u2192 Will China's Covid Zero policy end in November or December, 2022?\n\n\nClose date updated to 2023-01-03 7:59 am\n[Market creator] Boklam\n[Creation date] 10-16-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 01-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: OK.  It's the new year in China already.  Time to resolve.  Resolving YES; reasons below. I'll give just two links; as far as I can tell, reporting on this issue is similar across English-language media. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zero-COVID#China https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2022\/12\/31\/the-impact-of-chinas-zero-covid-exit-is-china-really-vaccinated\/?sh=7f70341f2e6d Various media articles report that China's zero-covid policy has ended; for example, Forbes (above) calls it China's \"abrupt.... exit from Zero-Covid.\"  Media articles list specific policies that have been relaxed; they don't say what policies, if any, remain in place.  I am left with the impression that life is mostly back to normal.  (International travel into China remains restricted, until Jan. 8; that's the only specific example I found of a policy that remains strict.) I don't know what official case numbers are.  Unofficially, it seems that a large fraction of China's population is infected; I believe this with high confidence*.  AFAIK the government has not moved to impose any new restrictions in response. *  My best guess is that 10-90% of China's population has been infected with Covid in the last month or two. --- Yes, I see that China announced an official policy change dated Jan. 8, and of course this market doesn't care what happens after the new year.  But my best judgement is that Zero Covid is already over.\n---\n[Date]: 12-20-2022\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]: Further thoughts on how I might resolve.  (I don't like those markets where everybody is left to guess \"what does the market creator think about ...\") Warnings: This will not resolve until the end of the year (China local time), plus enough time (a few days) for the media to report on anything that may have happened up to the end of the year.  Also I have not done any research beyond clicking on links y'all posted in the comments. I suggested 4 criteria I might consider.  Well, here we go: -1- Facts on the ground: AFAICT China's covid policy is generally much more lax now.  Maybe not as lax as Western countries, even in 2021 -- I don't have detailed information -- but significantly relaxed compared to a few months ago. -2- AFAICT Western media (who AFAICT coined the term \"Covid Zero\" without definition) pretty much uniformly say that \"Covid Zero\" is over. -3- I don't know what China's official case numbers are, but actual case numbers, I assume, are very high, and I haven't heard that China has done any tighten-things-back-up in response.  However I suppose this could change. -4- That other market seems to be in doubt only because of uncertainty about the meaning of the word \"officially\": does it mean \"by official public decree\", \"by official decision\", or is it an empty filler word with no meaning at all?  If the other market resolves NO because CCP didn't make an official announcement... I don't care. So I think YES is likely at this point.  Here are two possible doubts. -1- I look into things and determine that China's current policy is still quite strict, despite media reports.  I think this is reasonably likely: the media are good at reporting change, bad at reporting absolute numbers (i.e. the media will tell you about the derivative, not the value).  Maybe I will look into things and find China still has a lot of onerous policies, and things have really changed relatively little.  Then factor (1) above might end up as a mild NO vote.  Given factors (2) (3) (4), I expect this market would still resolve YES. -2- China decides to bring back their strict policies.  Oops, jk, changed our minds.  It happens, occasionally. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign If they reinstate the policy before the end of December, then for the purposes of this market, Covid Zero did not \"end in December\".  But if they reinstate Jan. 1, it did.\n---\n[Date]: 12-10-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Here's a plausible scenario.  China does not announce an official change in policy, but the reality on the ground looks like, say, Germany or California in late 2021.  Various restrictions remain in place (e.g. mask mandates, proof of testing required for access to certain indoor venues), while the stricter measures (forced relocation to quarantine centers, not letting people exit residential compounds, blocking travel to and from cities) are cancelled.  This will mean that even known infected people end up getting out into society (as surely happens in the West all the time: when rules are not enforced, not everybody will obey). Assume in addition: Western media say \"Zero Covid ended\"; case numbers in China climb very fast (and China doesn't respond with lockdowns); and related markets resolve to \"Zero Covid is over\".  (I think, given the \"plausible scenario\" above, these \"additional assumptions\" are very likely to hold.) In this scenario I absolutely will resolve to YES. Again, if you want to ask about some other potential scenario, I'd be happy to dicuss.\n---\n[Date]: 12-10-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I assume you read my comment above, where I laid out some of the factors I will consider.

A de facto end to the policy is certainly an end to the policy.  I care about reality on the ground, not official written policy. More subtle: What exactly counts as \"ending Covid Zero\"?  The term never had a precise definition; it was just a word for \"all those strict things China is doing\".  Here are some factors I might consider: -- China's de facto policy: what are the restrictions on the ground?  Where is China's policy in comparison to China's policy mid-2022 and most Western countries' policies mid-2022. -- What Western media say about Covid Zero.  AFAICT the term \"Covid Zero\" was created by Western media (if this is wrong let me know); in the absence of a precise definition, if they say it's over, that probably means it's over. -- China's case numbers (from official reports) and reactions.  \"Covid Zero\" taken literally implies \"zero tolerance\" to cases. -- The resolution of related markets like the following. https:\/\/manifold.markets\/ManifoldMarkets\/china-officially-abandons-covid-zer\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Reopened.

Mainland China has administered at least 3,409,697,000 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that\u2019s enough to have vaccinated about 122% of the country\u2019s population. But yes i'm afraid that China is still lack of natural immunity since their vaccines proved not that effective compare to mRNA vaccines. Good news is Covid has become less dangerous than it was which gives China a good exuse to slow down the mRNA vaccines' import. Chinese people know about mRNA, they just don't think it's a necessary to have one. I think it's a bit hard for me to explain the whole logic here but bear in mind that Chinese governament is not willing to spend money (US$) on keeping his people safe. And therefore Chinese people were 'educated' to believe that their governament was really making efforts to protect them from Covid. Everything in China is political. And sadly, trust governament & trust the communist party is the only 'politically correct'.\n---\n[Date]: 09-01-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Hope you find blow helpful. 1.

It\u2019s estimated 250-700 people died because of the storm. And 10+ million residents were issued boil water notices.  This storm peaked at about 400,000 without power, roughly 2,000 didn\u2019t have power after 7 days, about 10 deaths have been attributed to the storm. \n---\n[Date]: 02-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Well I had a clear idea on how I would like to resolve it, but that the interpretation has been more ambiguous then I initially thought.

Less then 3% of Texas customers are without power, versus the 30%+ in 2021. This is an Austin city power problem, not a Texas grid problem.  If the circumstances that have crippled parts of Austin crippled more cities, then Id resolve this to yes, but from what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s really only the one city and a few  rural areas. I\u2019ll dig into more articles, reporting, and possibly defer to subject matter experts about it this weekend. But I\u2019m still a believer It\u2019s not widespread failure. it was a very different beast in 2021. The spirt of the market was more like 10% of Texas or more, not just one city.

And we should generally buy talent at wide receiver in fantasy football.\n\nSo, yeah, this one is a little tough for me to write.\n\nSituationally, I'm just a little worried as the Steelers get acclimated to this new era. Over the last two seasons, only Tampa Bay has thrown more passes than Pittsburgh. Johnson's seen an impressive target share over these two years -- it was at 27.5% per game last year and 23.6% the year before -- and that resulted in huge target totals. He's fourth in the NFL at wide receiver in total targets during this time.\n\nPittsburgh is almost definitely going to be more run-heavy without Ben Roethlisberger. That'll naturally lower Johnson's volume. But what if whoever's under center isn't peppering Johnson the same way Big Ben did?\n\nJohnson's average depth of target ranked in the 24th percentile among 50-plus target wideouts last year, largely because the Steelers ran an offense that surrounded the idea of getting the ball out quick. With a more mobile passer and a hopefully improved offensive line, what if that changes? What if that allows players like Chase Claypool and George Pickens to develop more plays down the field?\n\nThis isn't to say Johnson's incapable of doing that, too. Again, he's a great wide receiver. There's just an outcome here where he's not seeing the same type of volume in the Pittsburgh offense this year, which is concerning for fantasy purposes.\n\nContext: \n\nIn his August 23rd, 2022 email newsletter, fantasy football analyst JJ Zachariason outlines 15 bold predictions that he describe as \"really possible\":\n\nWhy share a bunch of fantasy football bold predictions if they\u2019re not actually useful?\n\u00a0\nYou probably know by now that I\u2019m all about having a process in fantasy football.\n\nThat extends to bold predictions.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, bold predictions are just looking at either side of some range of outcomes. For a bold prediction to come true for a player, he\u2019s likely either hitting his floor, or he\u2019s hitting his ceiling. So you can still get mathematical and nerdy when putting together these wacky forecasts. You don\u2019t need to throw random takes at the wall and hope some of them stick.\n\nIn the spirit of getting mathematically and nerdy, I've created each of his 15 bold predictions as individual markets for his fans to track throughout the year in the Fantasy Football Bold Predictions group. It's very much expected that most of these will resolve negatively, but a few should turn out true.

They also play for the same team, potentially limiting each other's upside.\nWhy This Will Happen: With Tim Patrick no longer in the picture, we could see Denver's targets heavily funneled to Sutton and Jeudy. KJ Hamler isn't totally 100%, and the tight ends there are inexperienced.\n\nMeanwhile, Russell Wilson is one of five quarterbacks since 2011 with a touchdown rate north of 6%. The Broncos new head coach, Nathaniel Hackett, coordinated the Packers offense from 2019 through 2021, where they saw the most pass attempts at the goal line combined with the second-highest pass rate from that area of the field.\n\nTo put that all another way: We could see a lot of passing touchdowns in Denver this year.\n\nSince 2011, an average of 1.6 wide receiver teammates have finished together in the top-12 in PPR points per game per season. Sutton and Jeudy could be one of those pairs this year.\n\nContext: \n\nIn his August 23rd, 2022 email newsletter, fantasy football analyst JJ Zachariason outlines 15 bold predictions that he describe as \"really possible\":\n\nWhy share a bunch of fantasy football bold predictions if they\u2019re not actually useful?\n\u00a0\nYou probably know by now that I\u2019m all about having a process in fantasy football.\n\nThat extends to bold predictions.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, bold predictions are just looking at either side of some range of outcomes.

That's a 78th percentile mark among 50-plus target wide receivers.\n\nHe wasn't able to hit even 130 targets last year because of the run-heavy scheme he was in, but his target share was above 25%. Since 2011, check out the second-year wide receivers with a per-game target share of 25% or higher to go along with a yards per route run rate of 1.9: Josh Gordon, AJ Brown, Sammy Watkins, Justin Jefferson, Odell Beckham, Michael Thomas, Mike Evans, Alshon Jeffery, AJ Green, DeAndre Hopkins, Allen Robinson, Courtland Sutton, Jarvis Landry, Kendall Wright, and our man, Michael Pittman.\n\nThat's some very good company.\n\nWith Matt Ryan now under center, there's a chance we see a little more passing from Indy this year. It could all come together and make Pittman a top-five fantasy wideout.\n\nContext: \n\nIn his August 23rd, 2022 email newsletter, fantasy football analyst JJ Zachariason outlines 15 bold predictions that he describe as \"really possible\":\n\nWhy share a bunch of fantasy football bold predictions if they\u2019re not actually useful?\n\u00a0\nYou probably know by now that I\u2019m all about having a process in fantasy football.\n\nThat extends to bold predictions.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, bold predictions are just looking at either side of some range of outcomes.

Then you take your money and go buy some game off the shelf and are warry of pre-ordering games again unless it is from a game development company that has a strong track record of delivering.\n---\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Typically the closing time and market resolution are part of the \"market contract\" between the market creator and traders.   If you were to think about this in terms of time value, the longer the market runs the less value it has as it is discounted by time.  The 2% loans are meant to combat this issue with long term markets tying up liquidity you could otherwise be trading in shorter term markets. I am I to infer, that, based upon the quote, perhaps you are still hoping for a consensus resolution rather than an adjudicated resolution? Now it is my turn to show my own naivety, but when I entered the market I thought that surely a conversation in terms of math could dispel all ambiguity and result in ultimate consensus.  I have nearly limitless patience to engage on specifics, but I feel like not everyone does.  Such as the issue with summing conditional probabilities together that do not share the same conditional criteria.  Or conditioning on knowing that a game ended when we are looking at the conditional only that you are chosen.\n---\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  ah, THIS market clearly stated that the resolution and the close time could be quite distant depending on conditions.  I am not sure if I can re-open or if that is a admin\/trustworthy-ish action, but I am not inclined to have this market re-opened.  Reopening would make this less a predictive market and more of a news\/update market.  Also, I would be obligated to revise my holdings in light of developments thus far which could be seen as unfair to other holders that did not expect a market re-opening.\n---\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  new traders leads to rehashing old ground, but I would be cautious about having a market that will have a long closed period with out resolution when such a condition was not baked into the market.   The market should resolve asap and close no more than a day or two, a few days, before the market is resolved. All of that being said, I think there is certainly waning engagement on the market, so it could make sense to close it and focus on getting to resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 07-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I notice that the market close has pushed out to July 26th now.  \n---\n[Date]: 07-05-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:   What bearing does this have on selection or recruitment of mathematicians?

The recent Sheltering Humanity against Existential Risks (SHELTER) conference highlighted several uncertainties in the potential value of shelters as an X-risk intervention. Of these uncertainties, one aspect concerns the technical feasibility and cost of surface independent self sufficient food and life support systems (water, energy). Filling this knowledge gap would allow informed decision making to either rule out shelters as a cost effective x-risk intervention or catalyze development and deployment, estimated at 100 million to 1 billion USD (high value of information). ALLFED is uniquely positioned to lead research in this area due to knowledge in relevant resilient food production methods and experience in cost effectiveness analysis.\n\nHere's the mechanism by which the applicant expects their project will achieve positive outcomes.\n\n\nPreliminary technical analysis fleshes out the technical feasibility and requirements of shelters\u2019 life support systems (food, water, energy) reducing current uncertainties around cost and increasing specificity and tangibility of developing shelters. This allows informed decision making on whether shelters should be pursued or abandoned as a cost effective means of X-risk reduction. If results are favorable, we expect that interested parties will be motivated to begin further R&D, using preliminary technical analysis to inform development plans. Interested parties (industry, non-profit, gov) set up orgs and develop and pilot required tech. Parties collaborate to combine various technologies to create and pilot shelter design(s). Full scale implementation of shelters capable of sustaining a minimum viable population occurs. Humanity has the capacity to survive extinction-level events and repopulate after a range of X-risks (though this is dependent on results of civilization recovery research).\u00a0\n\nHow much funding are they requesting?\n\n\n$500,000\n\n\nWhat would they do with the amount specified?\n\nResearch - $407,500 USD:\u00a0\n\nPreliminary nutrition assessment of closed loop food - months 1 - 6\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Juan Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, ALLFED Research Associate (existing)\n\nAs discussed above preliminary nutrition analysis would be initiated immediately.\n\nHiring of researchers - months 1 - 3:\u00a0\n\nALLFED ops staff\u00a0\n\nHire researchers (2 researchers for 18 months) with relevant skills to undertake technical analysis.\n\nTechnical analysis of shelters life support systems - months 3 - 21\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Juan Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, ALLFED Research Associate (existing), Research Associate (new hires), Specialist Advisors (multiple individuals)\n\nThis would focus on the following topics (in addition to nutrition and cost effectiveness) covering technical analysis of key shelter requirements to be investigated:\u00a0\n\nShelter in-situ closed loop food production\n\nShelter heat rejection\u00a0\n\nShelter energy production\n\nShelter recovery food (maintaining farming with a small population)\u00a0\n\nShelter in-situ closed loop material, water and waste management\n\n\nStakeholder mapping and consultation- $92,500 USD:\n\nStakeholder mapping and consultation - months 6 - 21\u00a0\n\nSpecialist advisor(s) and ALLFED research associate (existing):\n\nExisting researcher in association with a specialist advisor(s) would map key players (industry, academia, gov) and convert academic publications to formats suitable for target audience.

The text beneath each heading was written by the applicant. Alternatively, you can click here to see the entire public portion of their application. \n\nWhy the applicant thinks we should fund this project\n\nActors in the effective altruist and longtermist space face significant uncertainties such as how to frame EA and longtermism to be most effective in convincing key players, policymakers, or new segments of the general public. Rethink Priorities\u2019 Survey Team can help with those questions by conducting timely and accurate polls, surveys and messaging studies. Being able to talk about our movement in a way that is more aware of how the public will perceive it will allow us to better grow and shape the movement going forward, especially in the face of a lot of new media growth. \n\nWe face broad strategic questions affecting the movement as a whole (e.g. \u201cWhat are the implications of associating \u2018effective altruism\u2019 and \u2018longtermism\u2019?\u201d, or \u201cWhat are the costs and benefits of developing separate brands such as \u2018global priorities research\u2019?\u201d) that we don\u2019t have good answers to yet. Our research will help with that. Our work can also reduce significant downside risks for the movement and potentially reduce the risk of negative and unexpected PR backlash.\n\nHere's the mechanism by which the applicant expects their project will achieve positive outcomes.\n\nOur research will help identify which messages, arguments and framings can be expected to perform better or worse, as well as what generally leads to different approaches performing better or worse with specific audiences. EA and longtermist organizations can then optimize their outreach based on these insights. EA and longtermist actors can likewise mitigate the risk of harm to the movement by avoiding messages which might seem reasonable to EAs, but which provoke negative reactions from other groups.\n\nOur work can also identify potential harms to the movement by providing an early warning where EA or longtermism and their associated ideas are perceived negatively (for example, by identifying public misconceptions), allowing decision-makers to take ameliorative action (for example, by working to correct or avoid these misconceptions).\u00a0\n\nOur research could also inform decision-makers\u2019 actions regarding concrete initiatives. For example, decision-makers might be reluctant to support an initiative due to concern that it will be seen as \u2018weird\u2019 by the public. Yet empirical research might show that this concern is misplaced (and, conversely, initiatives which decision-makers believed to be innocuous, might be perceived negatively).\n\nTo sum up, Rethink Priorities produces insights which help effective altruists better understand how the lay public thinks about EA and longtermism, which helps to better position EA for future growth, potentially reallocating resources, shifting programs, or proposing successful policies.\n\nHow much funding are they requesting?\n\n\n$ 457,950\n\n\nWhat would they do with the amount just specified?\n\nWe would make sure the current Surveys Team is funded reliably so that they can work on the projects they deem most high-impact rather than only chasing contracts or doing pro bono work for organizations.\n\n\nWe would pay salaries, including all taxes and benefits, for 3 FTE researchers.\u00a0\n\n\nWe would spend another $11,200 on directly project-related research supplies, equipment, technology, and travel.\n\nEmploying these three staff to work on this project also creates administrative costs (HR, communications, finance, development, etc.), which is necessary to sustain the research and enable the work of the team going forward.

The text beneath each heading was written by the applicant. Alternatively, you can click here to see the entire public portion of their application. \n\nIn brief, why does the applicant think we should we fund this project?\n\nBiosecurity Legislative Boot Camp: Congressional funding and support for pandemic preparedness, biodefense, and biosecurity monitoring falls short of addressing the scope of the threat and of fully utilizing available technology and capabilities (e.g., vaccine production; BARDA; wastewater pathogen sampling). Bringing these issues to the attention of policymakers and those who directly advise them could result in increased attention, and ultimately better-informed, faster, and concerted legislative action. The boot camp format has previously been used to increase awareness of policy solutions to cybersecurity problems and to build a network among congressional staffers and research-affiliated experts; this network has resulted in ongoing consultative opportunities and participants\u2019 involvement in crafting cybersecurity policy, which I expect would translate to the domain of biosecurity with the involvement of appropriate personnel and experts in a similarly formatted program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDual-Use Capabilities of Protein Folding Tools: Recent advancements in AI- and ML-enabled molecular modeling and simulation have led to breakthroughs in the ability to predict protein folding and bound structures of multiple proteins (e.g., ligand-receptor docking and antibody binding). While some work has been done on the potential applications of these capabilities to chemical design, and the dual-use nature of this work, very little has been done thus far to explore the current and near-term capabilities of protein-folding simulation tools to enable the directed design of pathogens. It is important to know the capabilities of these tools to design mechanisms of safety and review for their use, and to predict potential misuse for the purpose of planning for or mitigating the results of that misuse.\n\nHere's the mechanism by which the applicant expects their project will achieve positive outcomes.\n\nBootcamp: As with previous bootcamps, I expect that sustained and intensive engagement with these issues and a small community of both fellow staffers and experts will do two things: heighten the saliency of these topics and issues for the staffers, and create informal networking relationships and bonds between participants (both among staffers, and between staffers and experts) that lead to consultation and collaboration in the near future. The small, informal, and off-the-record nature of the bootcamps tends to build camaraderie better than a formal public conference, and staffers feel important for having been purposely selected to attend, causing them to view their fellow attendees as being similarly important, and therefore worthy of working with in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nResearch: Publication and dissemination of research about dual-use capabilities tends to attract the attention of regulators and researchers (see, e.g., the attention paid to Filippa Lentzos et al.\u2019s recent publication on dual-use AI-enabled drug discovery - https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s42256-022-00465-9). Presentations and talks to relevant groups (nonproliferation groups, university departments and programs, State Department CTR) are also good mechanisms for propagating this type of work and spurring the development of regulatory guidelines, but the research and computational work has to be done first to demonstrate the reality of the threat.\n\nHow much funding are they requesting? \n\nBootcamp: $130,225\n\nResearch: $6,000\/month stipend for 12 months - $72,000.\u00a0\n\nTotal: $130,225 + $72,000 + 8% overhead: $218,403\n\nOverview bootcamp budget:\n\nFlights, transportation to\/from campus, and accommodations for ~30 staffers\n\nAssuming 30 participants, $58,500 total\n\nRoom reservations, event services, waste management\n\n$5,500 total\n\nBreakfast (2x), Lunch (3x), and Dinner (2x) catering\n\nAssuming 30 participants, $10,575 total\n\nStaff time (facilitator\/organizer, logistics coordinator)\n\nAssume 80 hours each for prep for logistics and organizer\n\n12 hours per day for three days each for the event\n\n10 hours each for post-event work (reimbursements, communication)\n\nAssume $75\/hour, four staff, $32,400\n\nStipends for travel and time for visiting speakers\n\n$18,500 total\n\nPrinted materials\n\n$2,250 total\n\nField trip (if possible)\n\n$2,500 total\n\nHere you can review the entire public portion of the application (which contains a lot more information about the applicant and their project):\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1Eh4C5ThTWTR0JP-oUXkWbFrmjo9h3XP4DnXQODP8pso\/edit\n\nSep 20, 3:45pm: \n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-10-01 2:59 am\n[Market creator] Clearer Thinking Regrants\n[Creation date] 09-15-2022\n[Closing data] 10-01-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 10-17-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Note that, as per our Tournament rules, \"A market will resolve in favor of a project being funded if Clearer Thinking selects that project as one to provide any funding to (even if, for some reason, the project fails to receive the money - for instance, if it is shut down by the people running it before the money is received).\"\u00a0 We selected the bootcamp component of this project and recommended that the Future Fund provide funding to it, which is why the market is resolving as \"yes.\" However, the Future Fund did not act on our recommendation to give a grant to the bootcamp because another regrantor has recently recommended to fund it already.

If it seems at all close on that user threshold, assume \"yes\".\n\nAttack must occur within calendar 2023, UTC.  Detection\/disclosure of attack need not be.\n\nThe architecture of the service must primarily or exclusively be around storage of encrypted user password vaults.  A generic cloud-storage \/ file management service (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) does not count.  Password security\/strength checkers that incidentally use and store metadata\/previous breaches to evaluate secure passwords also don't count.  (ok I probably could have just said YouHaveBeenPwned\/Pwned Passwords, here).\n\nAt least one user password being displayed to the attacker and\/or exfiltrated as a data download (even if an encrypted version of that password) qualifies as a breach, provided it was by an external and unauthorized party.  (An employee absconding with a jilted lover's password file does not count). * see caveat in criterion #7.\n\nThe breach must be disclosed in a major media outlet, if not by the company directly.  If a publication is remotely questionable on this criteria, assume \"no\".\n\n(Added 2023-01-17) A second (through nth...) breach of LastPass does not count for this market.  It must be a non-LastPass service.  (That said, if some really wild edge case happens, like LastPass acquires a qualifying service and the breach is or seems to be entirely isolated to \/ affecting that service and its users, I reserve the right to go with YES after all.)\n\n(Added 2023-01-25) A bulk attack on the service, using credential stuffing or other techniques that don't exploit a bug or vulnerability, and that results in a widespread compromise of user accounts will count, if there are clear preventive measures that a password security service could have taken to prevent them.  For instance: \n\nlacking two-factor authentication\n\nnot checking or having weak requirements for password strength for vaults' master passwords\n\nnot having a means to stop or throttle bulk malicious traffic \n\nThese all feel like negligence on the part of the password security service.  \n\nCaveat: isolated reports of a single user's or targeted set of users' passwords being obtained through credential stuffing, phishing, social engineering, etc. (even someone high-profile like a government leader or celebrity technology leader) will not count, even if such an episode would otherwise pass criterion #4.  The rubric here will be \"does it seem like they were going for specific individuals or just every user account they could find?\"  \n\nIf an attack is discovered that started prior to 2023, but spans\/spanned into 2023, the attack will not count unless it is evident that the company knew about the initial attack, did no mitigation, and left themselves open to a second, distinct copycat event that did occur in 2023.  \n\nAdded 2023-01-25) This market will resolve YES earlier than the close date when a) there is a public report of a potentially qualifying breach and b) the company has either admitted or confirmed a sufficient number of details to pass all the criteria.  A news report purporting all sufficient details itself isn't enough, and I will allow the time needed for the impacted service to conduct their investigation to confirm.\n\n\nOtherwise, this market will close at midnight 2024 UTC.  The resolution will be four months later on May Day (lol) 2024 UTC.  (Based on four months between the attack and disclosure for LastPass).  If a suspected but unconfirmed breach is being reported by a service as of May Day, the market resolution will remain pending until that investigation concludes (or \"all conclude\" if there are, heaven forbid, multiple ongoing).\n\n(Added 2023-01-26) List of services that are being or had been considered as resolution candidates:\n\nNorton Lifelock \/ Norton Password Manager - NO\n\n\n[Market creator] Matt C.

The fact that several articles point to Norton not requiring 2FA, and (evidently) not using something like PwnedPasswords integration (or any password strength detection\u2026 ?),  and  not having any throttling or killswitch on bulk attacks means imo there is some negligence here on the part of a  password security service .

But polls show a 55-60% preference for a speed limit.\n\nThe german goverment coalition (social democrats, green and liberals) is divided on this topic. The green party argues that it's impossible to reach the climate goals without a speed limit while the liberal party argues that imposing a general speed limit would be an excessive state intervention. The social democratic party is siding slightly in favour of a speed limit.\n\nThe topic was already anticipated to become controversial during the coalition talks because both, the green and the liberal party, promised in their election campaign to impose a speed limit\/never impose a speed limit. There are now several other laws that the liberal party is trying to pass and they may try to use the speed limit as leverage in negotiations with the green party.\n\nThe market will resolve true if the german Bundestag passes a law by dec 31st 2023 or earlier that imposses a general speed limit on german roads, regardless of when the law will become effective.

Basically what I'm trying to capture here is companies being forced to significantly alter their models, limiting what everyone can produce with them.

The test is basically \"is it basically the same liability for making the image with Photoshop as with a generative model,\" or does it put fundamental restrictions on everyone who uses the generative software in a way that doesn't apply to Photoshop.

They're also welcome to bet for or against their opponents!\n\nOnce everyone has their hand, I'll make a general question about \"who will win\" that will track the status of the game, and then rapid (~1 day) questions for each of the four rounds of betting.\n\nEach player must commit a certain amount of mana on YES on themselves each round to advance to the next stage, as indicated by the round's trading history, otherwise they fold. Their commitment is the net of YES mana spent minus NO mana spent on themselves. This minimum equals half the lowest buy-in position that got into the game. This hand, that starts at 3.\n\nIf any player commits double or more than the minimum in any round, the minimum is doubled in all future rounds. i.e.: if the minimum mana to play is 20 and one or more people commit 40+, all future rounds have a minimum of 40, unless they get doubled further.\n\nThe Audience Hand works exactly like personal hands, except it:\n\nis publicly visible\n\ndoesn't have to buy in\n\nmust have twice the minimum, using bets from all bettors, to advance\n\nThe round questions resolve at the end of the game to the winner(s), equally.\n\nIf two or more players stick it out to the end I'll reveal their hands, announce the winner, and resolve all the remaining questions accordingly.\n\nIf for whatever reason every player folds at any stage, the win goes to the player who held the highest bet on themselves in the previous round.\n\nThis hand is the first in a short tournament series. There are several ways to score points in the tournament (even if you don't get a hand).\n\nAs you might have noticed, the rules of this special variant allow for mismatched bets by players, so feel free to jump in even if you're intimidated by a whale in the water! They can do their thing, profit by playing market dynamics, and you can still come out on top :) Admins and Manifold staff also have no inherent advantage, so don't be shy!\n\nAs I'll know all of the cards, I won't be betting or playing in the rounds, and I cannot be bribed to reveal other players' information or tilt in your favor.

These questions are rapid, each round will only last about a day. I will close the River by hand at an undetermined time to avoid snipe eliminations.\n\nEach player must hold a certain amount of YES shares on their own Hand, Flop, Turn, and River questions at close of the betting round to have a chance to advance to the next stage. This self-position is called their \"wager\".\n\nThe player with the 4th\/3rd\/2nd\/1st highest wager in the round is called the Pivot Player (Hand\/Flop\/Turn\/River). If the player who would be the Pivot doesn't have a positive wager, the role moves to the lowest-standing player who does.\n\nEach player needs to wager \u2265 1\/2 of the Pivot Player's wager to advance, otherwise they fold.\n\nA player's questions will resolve NO if they fold, NO if they lose, and YES if they win. They can also resolve PROB if the end of the game is a split (75% for a two-way split, 66% for a three-way, 50% if it's somehow a four-way).\n\nIf two or more players stick it out to the end I'll reveal their hands, announce the winner, and resolve all the remaining questions accordingly.\n\nIf for whatever reason every player folds at any stage, the win goes to the player who held the highest YES wager on the previous round.\n\nAs you might have noticed, the rules of this special variant allow for mismatched bets by players, so feel free to jump in even if you're intimidated by a whale in the water!

I've now added this round's player questions to the description. I'll be sending out hands next, over discord or email. If I don't have your info already and it isn't on your profile, please reach out to me @stralor on discord or  manifoldplayspoker@patrick-scott.com  to get your hand.\n","[Market title] Manifold Plays Poker: Who will win? (Hand 5)\n[Market description] Let's play a variation on poker! Like all the decent games of poker, this will be a lot about leveraging luck with strategy and mind games; a perfect match for a place about predictions imo.\n\nWe're playing a variation based on Texas Hold 'Em specially designed for working on Manifold over a series of markets, but everyone can participate and bet even if they don't buy a hand. See \"How It Works\" below for more info.\n\nThis is the central place for info for this hand. New questions will be posted here as we go.\n\nThis question resolves to the winner(s) equally at the end of the hand. Note that bets here don't determine the result of the game. Go to the current round's question for that.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nThe River, heads up (with the possibility of resurrection). The minimum is 40.\n\n[image]6 of diamonds, 3 of hearts, 7 of diamonds, 6 of hearts, and 3 of clubs showing on the board.\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Stralor\/manifold-plays-poker-the-river-hand-223b58db8e3d)The Audience\n\nEliminated in the Flop.\n\nQueen of Hearts, 2 of Hearts\n\nCheats\n\nIn this hand players and audience members can pay to do \"cheats\".\n\nCheats can be bought by adding a subsidy in the current betting round and commenting what cheat you'd like or sending me a managram with the same info, and all cheats count towards earning an extra tournament point for the hand, which is earned at 100 mana spent towards the prize pool. I'll respond with the answer privately, if it involves cards. Managrams will be added to a prize pool given to the winner(s) at the end.\n\nI will try to be timely in granting your cheat, but may take up to 12 hours to respond (so plan your cheats accordingly).\n\nMenu ~\n\n20 mana - see a card you haven't seen yet from a random player's current hand (not told which, can have been eliminated or unclaimed), up to 3 times\n\n50 mana - call a specific card and ask me if it's in the game\n\n50 mana - pair with another player, steal 25% of their resolution percent if they win, give them 25% of yours if you win. each player can be in one pair\n\n100 mana - resurrect your hand after folding\n\n100 mana - draw a replacement hand or join late, while supplies last. only 13 hands will be drawn (12 + the Audience), so you'll be grabbing one that wasn't claimed\n\nHow It Works\n\nYou can get a hand here before the game starts by paying the subsidy to add yourself to the list. Limited to the first 12 players (though I don't expect to have that many).\n\nPlayers who get a hand are welcome to share it, or team up, bluff, obfuscate, and misdirect, whether on the questions, over discord, or wherever they see fit. They're also welcome to bet for or against their opponents!\n\nAfter we fill up or a couple of days, I'll kick off the game with the first of the rapid (~1 day) questions for each of the four rounds of betting (Deal, Flop, Turn, River).\n\nEach player must commit a certain amount of mana on YES on themselves each round to advance to the next stage, as indicated by the round's trading history, otherwise they fold. Their commitment is the net of YES mana spent on themselves minus NO mana spent on themselves. This minimum starts at 10 mana for the Deal.\n\nIf any player commits double or more than the minimum in any round, the minimum is doubled in all future rounds. i.e.: if the minimum mana to advance in a round is 20 and one or more people commit 40+, all future rounds have a minimum of 40, unless they get doubled further.\n\nThe Audience Hand works exactly like personal hands, except it:\n\nis publicly visible\n\nwas bought in by me\n\nadvances by counting only YES bets on it, but needs double the minimum\n\nThe round questions resolve at the end of the game to the winner(s), equally.\n\nIf two or more players stick it out to the end I'll reveal their hands, announce the winner(s), and resolve all the remaining questions accordingly.\n\nIf for whatever reason every player folds at any stage, the win goes to the player who held the highest bet on themselves in the previous round.\n\nThis hand is part of a short tournament series. There are several ways to score points in the tournament (even if you don't get a hand).\n\nAs you might have noticed, the rules of this special variant allow for mismatched bets by players, so feel free to jump in even if you're intimidated by a whale in the water! They can do their thing, profit by playing market dynamics, and you can still come out on top :) Admins and Manifold staff also have no inherent advantage, so don't be shy!\n\nAs I'll know all of the cards, I won't be betting or playing in the rounds, and I cannot be bribed to reveal other players' information or tilt in your favor except with official cheats. My house cut is simply the trader bonuses on any questions I make for this, though I'll accept tips for my role as dealer if you're so inclined.\n\nOf course, side markets are welcome. Feel free to add them to the Manifold Plays Poker group and comment them here for shared visibility, and they'll count for the tournament!\n\nSide markets:\n\n@\/Jason\/manifold-plays-poker-hand-5-how-man \n\n@\/Stralor\/who-will-win-place-and-show-in-hand-38e051c645e7 \n\n@\/Stralor\/will-the-audience-make-it-to-the-fl \n\n@\/Stralor\/will-the-winning-hand-in-hand-5-of \n\n@\/ChristopherRandles\/manifold-plays-poker-hand-5-will-wi \n[Market creator] Pat Scott\ud83e\ude74\n[Creation date] 08-02-2023\n[Closing data] 08-08-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  yeah, that's more or less what it was before I was brainstorming added time. even if +12 hours is a little dicey for some folks with schedules, it still feels somewhat more fair. but Jason is right, I'll keep chewing on it\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  person who does replace card chooses which to replace, but the replacement card is \"drawn\" from the deck (will be pre-drawn and given in order, like everything else)\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  spread is flop + turn + river; I'll only tell you \"the card is (not) in the game\", doesn't count any unclaimed cards incl late join\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  maybe I could add 12 hours to a round timer if a resurrection happens, but this might cut stuff close to me needing to get on a plane. this still seems like the right move, tbh. then a player wouldn't needd to worry about end time\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  hmm I'm not sure how \"at least 12 hours before end of game\" plays out with random close times. 12h before maximum close time? tough to balance \"I missed a round of betting and need an opportunity window to resurrect\" vs. \"other players need a chance to respond to the resurrection\"\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  jotted down some notes, thinking I might make these changes: - resurrection, 100 mana, immediate upon purchase and declaration at least 12 hours before end of game, only get half of resolution (other half spread out; so in 2 split resurrectee gets 25% other gets 75%, in 1st 50% while 2nd gets 50%, modified further by pairings, etc.), still counts for full tourney points - late join, 75 mana + buy-in, immediate upon purchase and declaration at least 12 hours before end of game (though I might take a bit to respond and give the hand), 1x available - (new) replace a card in hand, 50 mana, random new card, old card declared publicly, 3x available - call-a-card only returns answer from spread and current hands at time of purchase (so may change if a late join\/ card replace happens)\n---\n[Date]: 08-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  good ideas!\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: HAND 6 \ud83e\udd73 \ud83e\udd73  Last chance for tourney points, and we're doing CHAOS mode\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  We'll leave this an open question for now.

Excellent, I had forgotten. We continue with a recap of the Sleeping Beauty problem. I have read many of these now and I can safely say that, of all of them, this one was written by Briggs. In Part 2, Rules for Halfers and Thirders, Briggs proposes a \"Halfer Rule\" which I'd summarize as \"ignore anthropic evidence\". In other words, never update probabilities based on \"de se\" evidence. If the coin has P(Heads) = 1\/2 in the view from nowhere, that is the P(Heads) I should believe in if I wake up as Beauty, regardless of whether I am told it is Monday. So this is a rule for the Double Halfer position which is not dependent on the Imaging Rule. It also seems a bit weird. If I am staring directly at a quantum coin, and it reads heads, that is maybe just \"de se\" evidence about which quantum branch I am in. So P(Heads) = 1\/2 despite the fact that I'm looking right at it. The paper does say earlier that there isn't a clear distinction between \"de se\" and \"de dicto\", so perhaps that is my confusion. The \"Thirder Rule\" is to pay attention to anthropic evidence. It's described as if it's SIA but this isn't an SIA vs SSA paper so I wouldn't weight that. No real justification at this stage of the paper, we're still just establishing the options. We go into a discussion of \"Weak Indifference\". It's helpful. As usual I am surprised by what other people consider counter-intuitive. My intuitions are probably messed up from excess sci-fi exposure. We also see an application to the Shooting Room Paradox (known on Manifold as Snake Eyes). You cannot simply have Weak Indifference over countably infinite perspectives. Not without some fancy math, at least. \"Weaker Indifference\" is \"Weak Indifference\" for people who distinguish \"risk\" from \"uncertainty\" and don't want to just have odds for everything. Meh. In part 3 we go onto Dutch Books. Stand back, we're going to try prediction markets. Helpfully there's some emphasis on how these arguments can be invalid due to \"deception\", which includes things we wouldn't think of as deception. Then finally we're on to the proof that Evidential Decision Theorists can be halfers. I'm excited, but ugh, this is some dense math. If I have this right, it's showing that everyone \"should bet at thirder odds\", whether they follow CDT or EDT. But EDT defines probability and calculates outcomes such that they need to have a halfer credence to bet at thirder odds. So no using Dutch Books to answer the Sleeping Beauty Problem. Then in part 4 Briggs does the whole exercise with Scoring Rules and comes to the same conclusion for the same reasons. I'm reading pages of math just to learn that there isn't an answer. This is why people hate mathematicians. Part 5, Stability. Help me part 5, you're my only hope. And actually yes, we get an intro to Technicolor Beauty and show that adding irrelevant information to the hypothetical makes everyone into a thirder. I wish that we had a worked Technicolor Beauty example of how an EDTist would assign credence and would bet, it's confusing. Then in part 6 Briggs shows her hand that this seems like evidence for the thirder position, and for CDT over EDT. This should maybe give slight pause to LessWrong readers who think that CDT is obviously wrong because of Newcomb's Problem. But probably some LessWrong-favored decision theory will also have Stability if anyone can make it concrete enough to apply to mythical princesses. Well, I started reading this paper because I wanted to find a halfer paper that was compelling and taken seriously by other philosophers. This isn't it! It's a thirder paper that is coy about it, just like Bayesian Beauty is all \"sure you can be a halfer or a thirder depending on your priors, it's just that the halfer priors are crazy town\".

Apparently there's a whole different way to \"update your beliefs\" that nobody has mentioned to me before, aka \"The imaging rule\". I'm not quite sure what to do with it. Cozic says: Cozic points to a difference between \"revising\" our beliefs and \"updating\" our beliefs. Revising is when I get new information about an unchanging state. Updating is when I get information about a state change. Right now I know that it's Monday. Soon I plan to become unconscious, hallucinate wildly, and forget it all. Then I'll wake up to my alarm clock, and learn that it's Tuesday. The alarm clock won't \"revise\" my beliefs, because there's nothing wrong with my current belief that it's Monday. But it will let me \"update\" my belief when I notice that time has passed. For revising beliefs we follow Bayes' rule, everything's the normal way things work. And for updating beliefs apparently we can follow the Imaging Rule. Which is not justified in this paper as a reasonable rule to follow. Probably I could go read \"Probabilities of conditionals and conditional probabilities\" and \"Can bayes\u2019 rule be justified by cognitive rationality principles\" and get an answer. The rule is: So I have some beliefs about the distribution of possible worlds as I go to sleep on Monday, and when I wake up on Tuesday I get a new distribution of possible world that look very similar, except they are all Tuesday worlds. Like a movie multiverse, upon learning that the universe is constructed entirely of legos, we still expect to see Lego Spiderman fighting with Lego Doctor Octopus. I'm pretty skeptical, frankly. Instead, I think I go to sleep on Monday and I have a model of the world, and when I wake up I run the model forwards some fuzzy amount of time, and my beliefs about the present time get correspondingly fuzzier, and then the alarm clock says it's 7am and they get sharper again. If I was doing an Imaging Rule update, maybe the w that is closest to w0 is the world where it's still Monday but I set my alarm clock wrong. Isn't that a \"closer world\" than the one where the Earth is a few million kilometers further around the sun? But suppose we come to accept that the Imaging Rule, does that tell us what Sleeping Beauty's probability should be? Beauty goes to bed on Sunday, in Sunday world. She wakes up and she knows it is Monday or Tuesday, Heads or Tails. Which of the three worlds is closest to Sunday world? Is Monday or Tuesday a \"closer world\" to Sunday? Whatever \"closer\" means here. Cozic's answer wasn't very clear to me. I think he calculates as if there are two Sunday worlds, \"Sunday-that-will-be-Heads\" and \"Sunday-that-will-be-Tails\", and then distributes the weight of those two worlds and ends up as a halfer. If instead I imagine a single Sunday world, and I distribute its weight equally between the three possibilities (HM, TM, TT), I would end up a thirder. Cozic closes by explaining that he doesn't have a rigorous distinction to offer between revising and updating and further research is required. Reading between the lines it looks like a peer reviewer spotted a gaping hole in his argument and he acknowledged it and published what was left anyway. And then as far as I can tell he never wrote anything more about the topic. And it seems like imaging rules continue to receive very little attention by other philosophers. I suppose it's possible that the philosophical consensus ends up landing in the vicinity of this paper, but that doesn't look like the current trend.\n---\n[Date]: 08-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  academic philosophers at some time, no time limit, supermajority.

This is obviously a simplification for the purpose of getting a crisp disagreement.

This is a short, clean paper, I'm glad I found it. It \"deflates\" the problem, by noting that there are actually two events: Groissman claims that P(E1=H) is 1\/2 and P(E2=HM) is 1\/3. Because they are separate events, there is no need for them to have the same probability. Beauty does not need to estimate the E2 probabilities by way of an update from E1 probabilities, because they are different events. He provides an inanimate version to further justify this. Overall I read this paper as defending the \"thirder\" position from the claim that Beauty is doing a mysterious evidence-less update, while following the Art of War and allowing \"halfers\" a path of retreat by emphasizing that P(E1=H) is indeed 1\/2.\n---\n[Date]: 08-05-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Oh yes, \"The End of Sleeping Beauty's Nightmare\" is much better. https:\/\/arxiv.org\/ftp\/arxiv\/papers\/0806\/0806.1316.pdf I'll maybe review that next and add it to the description.\n---\n[Date]: 08-05-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  There's a paper \"The Measure of Existence of a Quantum World and the Sleeping Beauty Problem\", so apparently you are not the only person who has had this crazy idea.\n---\n[Date]: 08-05-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I read the paper and I also found it pretty meandering. I think the main value I got was from the idea referenced from \"\u2018The End of Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Nightmare\" by Groisman, which distinguishes between: The Luna goes on to say that even though (1) if and only if (2), it's okay for their probabilities to differ, because they are sampled differently. So maybe I'll go read Groisman's paper and see if that is a better explanation of this point. There's a conflict between Bostrom's hybrid theory, which argues that the answer to SB is different if it is repeated vs if it is a single event, and Luna\/Groisman's Frequentist (I think?) approach that we calculate probabilities by repeating experiments a large number of times. If Bostrom is right then Frequentism cannot define probabilities for anthropic events.\n---\n[Date]: 08-03-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Review:  https:\/\/ora.ox.ac.uk\/objects\/uuid:44102720-3214-4515-ad86-57aa32c928c7\/ Bostrom has written clearer papers than this one. It's heavy going. Bostrom claims that neither 1\/2 nor 1\/3 are required by normal axioms of probability, and therefore looks to the consequences of each position to see if they might be counter-intuitive. I am not convinced at all by this approach. Anthropics is counter-intuitive, people routinely follow their intuitions into logical contradictions, and the universe is not required to be intuitive. In any case I can avoid \"presumptuous philosopher\" problems by admitting that I am fallible and may not have the right answer to anthropics. Instead, as a philosopher I would be eager for the experiment to go ahead and give us some solid evidence on philosophy. Then Bostrom proposes a hybrid model. Whatever I might think of his motivations for getting here, I am interested in a possible hybrid approach. This starts promisingly, where if we know that Beauty will be eventually told on Monday that it is Monday, we should model that as separate possible awoken states, for a total of five: I wish he went through the details of this and all its conclusions. Reading between the lines, I think Bostrom wants P(HEADS | H1 or T1 or T2) = 1\/2, and P(HEADS | H1M or T1M) = 1\/2. So the hybrid model is the \"double halfer\" position in this one-shot case. The last section is about long-run betting odds, which I very nearly discarded on the grounds that probabilities and betting odds can diverge. Fortunately I stuck with it, and the bets aren't load-carrying. It has a nice example of the case where Sleeping Beauty is put through the experiment two weeks in a row. In this case, P(Heads | awake and I don't know if it's Monday) = 5\/12. The paper concludes with a discussion of how you could run a dutch book against double-halfer Beauty, which Bostrom claims is an instance of probabilities and betting odds diverging. I am very comfortable with idea, perhaps too comfortable, so not really directed at me. Overall I think the paper does an okay job justifying how this hybrid model is a possible solution to the problem, but I'm completely unimpressed with Bostrom's attempt to justify it as a necessary solution. It's interesting that Bayesian Beauty used the same \"state expansion\" trick in a different way, and it makes me curious if one could expand the states in both ways at once to nail down the right answer.\n---\n[Date]: 07-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I don't want to tie you too much to your argument for a position you don't hold, but how much work do you think is done by the two days being identical? Eg, if during the day a coin is flipped to decide whether to play pool or snooker, does that mean that (if the coin results are diffeent) the days are not identical, and so in that variant the halfer you are simulating would agree that P(heads | awake) = 1\/3?\n---\n[Date]: 07-26-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Review:  https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10670-019-00212-4  - Bayesian Beauty, Silvia Milano (2022). I really liked this paper. Especially compared to standard internet commentary! Refreshing to see both positions taken seriously and described charitably. I think it has moved me to a personal position where I'm more confident that the thirder position is most correct. Of course one paper does not indicate a consensus, and there's much more to read here. Section 2: The Problem, is in my view the highlight. In carefully describing the problem, Milano practically solves it, reducing it to a problem of priors. To use a LessWrong term, we need to have a prior on how \"reality fluid\" is distributed between Monday and Tuesday. Although this is framed in terms of temporal uncertainty, I'm pretty sure the whole thing works just as well for spatial uncertainty, which would finally provide some kind of principled argument for approaches to anthropic reasoning. Things I have read prior to this have mostly been people arguing over which bullets are worse to bite, and none of that sways me. The universe doesn't care if the Doomsday Argument hurts my feelings. In Section 3: Solution, she pulls the trigger on arguing for the thirder position based on the  idea that Monday and Tuesday are both equally likely via the Principle of Indifference. I'm sure many would regard this is \"just common sense\" or the like, but I appreciate the dedication to rigorous argument. On the other hand, halfers need to have the prior P(Monday | Heads) = 1. Making this concrete, if Prince Charming tells halfer Sleeping Beauty that he had painted a picture of her sleeping on Tuesday, Beauty would not believe him, because P(Tuesday AND Heads) = 0. She is also completely indifferent to her sleeping conditions, because P(Awake) = 1. These are weird priors. On the other hand, we can construct variations on Sleeping Beauty where this is not such a weird prior. If the entire universe is paused (or destroyed) while Sleeping Beauty is asleep on Tuesday, then P(Tuesday & Heads)=0 seems valid. A solipsist philosophical stance (and an especially deep sleep) would do the same. Section 4: Matters of Principle, reassures me that Sleeping Beauty (and anthropic problems generally) don't in fact break the whole of probability. Less exciting, but thank you anyway. The universe is weird enough already. Section 5: Bets and Odds, is targeted at a different audience to me. Since betting in \"will the probability of this market go below 10%?\" and similar markets, I've come to the conclusion that for non-Cartesian agents like myself, credences and betting odds frequently come apart. But those who differ will find value. This is also the section where Evidential Decision Theory briefly rears its head. I will defer judgment on that until I read the referenced paper. I don't have much credence in EDT. I'm also thinking that the market refers to an \"ideal epistemic agent\", whereas decision theory is about actions, so it may not apply. Thanks to   for the citation. I've added it to the description.\n---\n[Date]: 07-26-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I'm not entirely clear on your point. I think the Bayesian Beauty paper takes careful pains to show how both halfer positions can be compatible with standard probability axioms, including Conditionalization and Reflection, with an unusual prior - that P(Monday | Heads) = 1. A footnote gives a similar answer for the \"double halfer\" position. Now, Milano thinks this is a bad prior, citing the Principle of Indifference: Practically speaking I think \u03b1=1 is also a bad prior for humility reasons. At least if I have an incorrect prior of \u03b1=0.5 I can update it based on evidence. But it is a valid prior in principle, and we could construct slightly different thought experiments where it is true. Here is another quote from Milano to that point: More generally, I wouldn't take a single 2022 paper as indicating a mathematical consensus on any controversial point. It is a great paper, though, I added it to the description above.\n---\n[Date]: 07-25-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  for what it's worth I thought section 2 (problem) was very valuable.

This collapses to regular Bayes in normal scenarios. The forgetting argument is a good way of avoiding that, though.

Otherwise they might only tell you that if you are H1, for example. I think this is the problem of reference class selection, which I read favors SIA but I don't yet understand why. If the reference class is \"person who is woken up and told that they are not H3 or T3\" then people like this exist in both branches of the universe, so SSA makes no anthropic update, and claims that p(heads) is 50%. Similarly for the reference class \"person who is woken up and told they are H3 or T3\", p(heads) is 50%. I'm not sure how this interacts with the normal Bayes update rule. I think it would need to be modified. This is consistent with my intuition that SSA observers experience a weird future and SIA observers experience a weird past.\n---\n[Date]: 07-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Variant: Prince Charming rolls a million-sided dice.

So thirder and halfer can make the same decision on Sunday about how to bet on Monday and Tuesday, since they have the same facts to hand. I'm unclear why they would bet differently for money. I think they would bet differently for utilons. If there is an opportunity to eat chocolate after the interview, before getting the amnesiac, but only for one coin flip result, thirder would prefer to get chocolate on tails.

The aim would be to phase out factory farming and the import of factory-farmed products in regions where such channels exist, drawing inspiration from the Swiss Factory Farm ballot initiative. In areas without direct democracy options, the organization will advocate for government policies to scale down factory farms and reduce stocking densities. The charity is likely to operate in high-income countries with a strong emphasis on animal welfare, aiming for a complete phase out of factory farms by 2050.\n\nPreventive animal welfare\n\nThis year our focus is on interventions and policies that prevent future harms done to animals, as opposed to solving current problems.

If Google's competitor files its 10-K in a different quarter than Alphabet (Google's parent company), the competitor's 10-K numbers can be compared with Alphabet's 10-K numbers for the same fiscal year. (For example, if Alphabet's 2018 10-K and its competitor's 2018 10-K show that the competitor had higher search-derived revenues during the 2018 fiscal year, the question will be resolved as \"YES\" even if Alphabet files in Q1 but the competitor files in Q2.) \n\nIf Google's competitor uses a currency other than the USD to denominate its revenues, the comparison between revenues should be calculated using the median exchange rate for the currencies over 365 days as calculated by a reputable financial data service. \n\n\"Search\" refers to queries that primarily return results from parts of the Internet not operated by the search engine company.

This means that if Google's search results are mostly links to Alphabet-related websites, they do not count as search queries. \n\nThe burden of proof is on showing that \"YES\" is true.

On average, the ship went down with four days-worth of oxygen on Sunday. The submersible has enough oxygen to last until 7am-midday Thursday.\n\nFactors such as oxygen levels, intense water pressure, and the remoteness of the area make the search difficult. \n\n The wreckage of the Titanic is also located at a depth of 13,000 feet \u2014 a point too deep for typical U.S. Navy subs \u2014 which typically go down to 2,000 or 3,000 feet \u2014 to descend to.\u00a0\n\nCanadian aircraft dropped a sonar buoy into the ocean listening for tapping or talking in an effort to pinpoint the submersible. Underwater sounds, with a banging noise every 30 minutes, were recently detected but sourcing efforts have not yielded results yet. \n\nFor context, when submarine crew face an underwater disaster and are unable to communicate with the surface they are advised to bang on their submersible's hull to be detected by sonar.\n\nSearch efforts have currently relocated to find the origin of the noises and more results are expected to arrive Thursday morning. Scientists warn that it's very difficult to discern the source of noises in the vast ocean and are analyzing all reported sounds in the search area.\n\nThe\u00a0Titan\u00a0has seven backup systems intended to return the vessel to surface in case of emergency, including a ballast that can be dropped, a balloon, and thrusters. Some of the backup systems are designed to work even if all aboard the submersible are unconscious; there are sandbags held by hooks that dissolve after a certain number of hours in the water and release the sandbags, letting the vessel float to the surface.\n\nThe fact that they didn't use one of the multiple methods to resurface indicates that they might either be stuck on something below the surface or that they experienced a structural failure and imploded.\n\nHowever, those aboard will know how to stretch their available air (as taught in Explorers Club training), and the cold environment will also depress metabolic body functions and decrease the air needed so there is a chance for a larger time window to help with search efforts.\n\nA remotely operated vehicle has recently discovered a \"debris field\" in the Titan vessel search area.\n\nFinal Update: The US Coast Guard confirms the Titan submersible imploded near the wreckage of the Titanic and has no survivors. May they rest in peace and well wishes are sent to the affected families.\"\n\nResolves YES if 1+ passengers are found and rescued in one week \u2014 up to June 23 (where we assume oxygen levels are extended beyond the current expected capacity of 70 hours)\n\nCase description paraphrased from live news reporting sources and forums:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/live-blog\/titanic-missing-submersible-live-updates-rcna90103\n\n[link preview]\n[Market creator] yasmeenbrain\n[Creation date] 06-20-2023\n[Closing data] 06-22-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Oceangate cease to operate before 2026?\n[Market description] Bankruptcy, dissolution and simmilar or anything that leads to them not conducting expeditions for longer than 1 year without visible progress being made counts as YES, regardless of name changes, acquisitions and such.

Former holders of these positions count as well. People who ran for these positions and lost (and never held one) do not count. Based on this initial list, I might add other qualifying positions; comment if I've missed anything. Edit: Also SCOTUS. Edit: \"credible\" means some chance of success.

See my runthrough of recent public attempts on recent presidents and how I would have adjudicated them in the comments.\n\nA few potential edge cases, and how I plan to adjudicate them if they come up:\n\n1. Murder of a politician, with an unshared\/unknown motive. If a politician is knifed by a junkie walking down a street that doesn't resolve \"yes\", but if a politician is found murdered I'll close the question and, in the absence of a likely motive which is unrelated to their political office, I'll resolve \"yes\" after a reasonable interval. Burden of proof will be on the \"no\" votes to show that it was not an assassination in this case.\n\n2. Some hopelessly crazy person who thought they were trying to assassinate a politician but who never could have in a million years will be resolved as \"yes\" if charges are brought which are directly related to the attempt; not resolved otherwise. Edit: This question won't resolve \"yes\" for any plot, no matter how intricate, unless the attempted assassination process was actually begun.\n\n3. The questions will close at the end of December if it hasn't resolved \"yes\" before then, but I'll hold off for a few weeks to make sure something late didn't get missed, or longer if there's still an ambiguous case pending.\n\nOther edge cases will be resolved in the spirit of these general guidelines.

Obama: April 2009 yes Nov 2011 no, random fire sprayed at the building is not a credible threat against a president. 0% chance of success, like the ricin stuff. All others were plots or mail attacks. Mail attacks have a 0% chance of success, and are not serious.  I'd adjudicate all of these as \"No\" except Sandford 2016 and April 2009.

Regardless of the outcome of the immediate media campaign and potential internal conflict, will Wagner Group and Russia eventually re-establish friendly ties and resume the invasion of Ukraine together by the end of 2023?\n\nThis market makes no distinction between whether Wagner is a de facto Russian government organization or not. An assumption this market is making is that there is a possibility of conflict between the two, even if they're otherwise one-and-the-same, but whether conflict actually arises or not doesn't affect the resolution of this market.\n\nPerhaps the recent news is a ruse to squash the pretty well-substantiated rumors that Wagner Group is simply another arm of Russia's military. Or it's a feint to allow a coordinated surprise push. I'm sure most of us are hoping it devolves into a destabilization of Russia's invasion, but even if it does will it be a lasting split or will they make peace with each other in favor of resuming their campaign against Ukraine?\n\n---\n\nUpdate to include some clarifications that you might find useful:\n\nThis is about the organization, not the individuals. Former-Wagner troops dont count, but Wagner-branded units do.\n\nWe're mostly looking for active deployment into battlefields. Sending them near the front to cool their heels and play CoD wouldn't satisfy.\n\nIf there exists conflict between Wagner forces and Russian forces in the same areas of deployment (broken and uncoordinated chain of command, squabbles about supply, or even exchange of fire, etc.), this won't resolve YES until that's seemingly resolved\n[Market creator] Pat Scott\ud83e\ude74\n[Creation date] 06-23-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  if true, I agree.

The deadline has been reached and the criteria stated that i should resolve by my gut feeling.  My gut feeling unambiguously says YES, but since this is a big market i feel obliged to go into greater detail. In the end i use a scientific paper to find a formal definition to work by. ======= End of Abstract ===== Okay, i resolve this market now, but first a bit of background. ======   Background and motivation ======    I created the market a few seconds after i heard of the russian infighting on my favorite social media site. Since i am on the ukrainian side on this, it sounded too good to be true. My social media site isn't really known for sharing reliable, accurate information so i used Manifold to try and get an estimate on the accuracy of the information and keep a discussion going. I could have elaborated more on how i just wanted to confirm\/disprove the rumours of the moment, but i feel like the title \"...right now\", and the first sentence \"Rumors are going round that...\" showed that already. ======   resolution criteria and discussion ======   I initially specified the following resolution criteria: \"Resolves early if there is widespread media consensus for either side.\" \"Otherwise resolves according to my gut feeling about this having been a coup or a false alarm.\" I also changed the definition of \"coup\" a bit by using the phrase: \"...Wagner units are attempting a coup against the russian ministry of defense.\" As this market got more and more attention there was a lot of discussion about the specifics which promted me to expand further on what i thought constitutes a coup: \"I'd define coup as an armed insurgency aimed to replace any higher official, including the Minister of Defence.\" \"I think what is going on could reasonably be described as a coup insofar as it involves a military organization turning on its own to remove a person in power.\" \"as for specifying the resolution criteria: I think if I see enough combat footage of Wagnerites fighting Russian forces I will be satisfied.\" My initial motivation was to get an answer to the question \"Are the russians really fighting against each other or is this just a rumour that will turn out not to be a big deal?\". Since this affair made world-news for several days and there was extensive footage ( https:\/\/www.oryxspioenkop.com\/2023\/06\/chefs-special-documenting-equipment.html ) this question has been answered as a resounding YES. I felt quite confident with that until the wagnerites stopped 300km south of Moscow the next day. At this point the discussion started to revolve around the question wether \"a coup that hasn't happened\" could still be counted as a coup. To this i didn't have an intuitive answer, so i promised to not resolve the market early. But i still want to look at what the media has to say. ======  Media-consensus ======   In order to assess the this i searched for news articles to see what they called the Event. Here are articles that at some point called it a \"coup\": Guardian: \"The Wagner uprising: 24 hours that shook Russia\" \"Prigozhin\u2019s breezy coup attempt, or march for justice as he meekly put it, was real.\" https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jun\/25\/prigozhins-march-on-moscow-chronology-of-an-attempted-coup Kyiv Post \"Prigozhin's coup attempt was a \"black swan\" event that put Moscow on edge and could be the beginning of Putin's end.\u00a0\" https:\/\/www.kyivpost.com\/videos\/18905 Here are some articles explaining that it actually wasn't a coup. William Partlett from the university of Melbourne wrote \"Why Prigozhin\u2019s march on Moscow was not a coup\". I found that article interesting to read because of the \"dual-state\"-thing but in the end Partlett's analysis hinges on the fact that Prigozhin propably didn't want to bring down the regime of Putin and we already assessed that point. https:\/\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\/articles\/why-prigozhin-s-march-on-moscow-was-not-a-coup The New Yorker wrote in \"What Prigozhin\u2019s Half-Baked \u201cCoup\u201d Could Mean for Putin\u2019s Rule\" https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/q-and-a\/what-prigozhins-half-baked-coup-could-mean-for-putins-rule that \"this was not an attempt to conduct a coup. It was a gesture of desperation.\", which also doesn't bring us much further because why wouldn't a coup happen out of desparation? The Guardian -despite earlier calling it a coup-attempt- calls it \"less an attempted coup, more an impulsive demonstration that got out of hand\". https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jun\/30\/could-yevgeny-prigozhin-really-have-captured-moscow-wagner-russia Some call it something else: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/06\/26\/wager-coup-putins-regime-looks-deeply-damaged-despite-failure-of-coup.html \"so-called 24 hour coup\", or \"rebellion\". Some only quote people calling it a coup: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/2023\/06\/23\/world\/russia-ukraine-news All in all i think that there isn't a real consensus. Especially not if you take into account that our definition of a coup (coups can target the ministry of defence) is a bit different than the official one.  So how to decide?  Gut-feeling: Yes Media consensus: N\/A, or No ====== Political Science to the rescue! ======  The Wikipedia article on \"coup d'etat\" links to an article in the \"Journal of Peace Research\" from 2011, written by Clayton Thyne and Jonathan Powell from the University of Kentucky. They looked at 14 studies on coups from 1950 to 2010 and worked out a definition of what constitutes a coup. Just what we need! https:\/\/www.uky.edu\/~clthyn2\/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf They define a coup by five criteria. Here is a short summary of the interesting parts with my comments after the bullet points: Targets: The first factor in arriving at a definition is in deciding who may be targeted. We remain consistent with previous research by considering only attempts to overthrow the chief executive. Perpetrators: Coups may be undertaken by any elite who is part of the state apparatus. These can include non-civilian members of the military and security services, or civilian members of government Tactics: Two factors must be considered [...]: First, the activity must be illegal.  Second, a near-universal criterion for coups is that violence does not have to be present. Plots and rumors: [We opt to] coding only cases where coup attempts were \u2018overt\u2019 (there has been a visible movement to claim power) and \u2018actual\u2019 (the events are not alleged ex post facto in some kind of trial proceeding). Success and failure: We [...] differentiate between failed and successful efforts. A coup attempt is [...] defined as successful if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven days. =====Summary and Conclusion==== It could be possible for the naysayers to find another, slightly different definition of \"coup\" and start a discussion again. After all this is political science, so there are propably multiple schools of thought fighting each other. But all i could find was this paper here: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1BndbowTxB245Hc3hOOWdYisBJpULcKM9\/view?pli=1 ... wich contains a nice flowchart (Figure 2: Coding Rules), but makes the grave error of requiring the perpetrators to seek power. I think it is nigh impossible to asses the true intentions of an honest person, let alone the ones of a political figure. This sounds like a recipe for endless unproductive debate and i have a market to resolve so you can get your fake internet points back. So I'll stop this here and now. The resolution criteria stated that i should go by my gut feeling which i do. I hope i was able to explain my thought process a bit and thank you all for engaging in my market.

They defended their thesis successfully - the topic was geometric group theory - sent off the paper, was preliminarily accepted, went back and forth with revisions for most of the first half of 2022, sent off what was intended to be a final revision, and hasn't heard back from Reviewer in almost a year.\n\nLorxus currently lives in [Fox City], a mid-sized city in the northeast US, where the university hosting their postdoctoral program is located, and where Editor, the journal's editor, works, right across the hall from Lorxus. The two are on cordial terms, and Editor claims to have been repeatedly messaging Reviewer to try to get them to review the paper.\n\nLorxus's postdoc position will end in July, and they don't expect that they'll be rehired by the university.\n\nThus do we ask: will Lorxus's paper appear as a submission in Journal before Lorxus ups stakes, leaves their den, and moves to a different city to pursue a different opportunity, or the year 2024 arrives?\n\nThe market resolves early to YES if the paper is accepted for publication in Journal before Lorxus moves house next, and NO if 2024 rolls around and Lorxus still hasn't had their (basically finished) paper published.\n[Market creator] Lorxus PhD \ud83e\udd8a\n[Creation date] 04-10-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: We are approaching the end of the year, and the journal, which has already published 9 issues this year, may well not have time to publish another.

They have said that the full details of how this \"de facto referendum\" will work will be agreed at a special conference planned in March. \n\nThis market is about whether they backtrack on the plan. It's inevitably going to be a little subjective.

I can't actually work out whether this would be easier or harder than 50% overall. Feel free to comment to say whether you think this should count or not.

Case against:  So I think there's a case for NA (because the convention wasn't a decision making space, which is kind of like not taking place (which I specified would result in NA)) or for leaving the market open and resolving after the party conference (I'd rather not do this; it seems to much against the letter of the market) or for YES, because the leader of the party has clearly backtracked from the previous leader's plan.
