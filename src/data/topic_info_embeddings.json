title] Do IQ tests measure intelligence?\n[Market description] Resolves to the PROB I assign to the notion of \"IQ tests measure intelligence\", which I will likely translate into \"IQ tests measure g and g is intelligence\" unless I get convinced that g is not a good way of thinking about IQ tests.\n\nAt the time of making this market, I feel like IQ tests measure general cognitive abilities (g), that is, things which are useful across a wide variety of cognitive tasks. So if there's something about your mind that is useful for both playing video games, understanding the meaning of words, being good at programming, etc., then that thing is going to be measured by IQ tests. However, I think it is limited what useful things IQ tests measure beyond g.\n\nAt the time of making this market, I think g is a big component in the everyday concept known as \"intelligence\", but I doubt that it is the only thing that people think of as intelligence. Other things I think people might think of as intelligence include:\n\nAbility to deal with the most common situations everyone encounters, e.g. being socially skilled, not clumsy, having common sense (this is affected by g, but not identical to g, because factors that only affect ability to deal with common situations and don't generalize well would still be considered intelligence)\n\nAbility to deal with the most common situations one uniquely encounters, e.g. being good at one's job, specialty and hobbies (this is again affected by g, but not identical to g, because factors that only affect this and don't affect general abilities would count as intelligence but not g)\n\nHaving stereotypically intellectual interests e.g. math, science, history, or high-brow politics (again this may be affected by g if g affects ability in those areas and ability affects interests, but it is not identical to g if there are unique factors that influence interests)\n\nAgreeing with and defending society's taboos, even when they are wrong\n\nThis is not meant to be an exhaustive list, though I think these are the most convincing possible alternatives to g. Since it is not exhaustive, shooting down these possibilities might not entirely convince me that IQ tests measure intelligence, though since it is the most convincing alternatives, it would definitely update me upwards.\n\nAn example of something that would convince me that IQ tests measure the commonsense concept of intelligence would be a study showing that if you have ask informants who know people well to rank people's intelligence, then the g factor has a correlation of >0.8 with the latent informant consensus factor. It is currently my understanding that the correlation is more like 0.5-0.7, though I haven't seen a satisfactory study yet to be sure.\n\nI will not be trading in this market.\n[Market creator] tailcalled\n[Creation date] 02-04-2023\n[Closing data] 04-06-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-18-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I'm actually confused about why so many people bet yes, because I feel like I gave an explanation of why I was skeptical of YES in the market description. I assume it's because people didn't read it all\/because it was too technical, but idk.\n---\n[Date]: 04-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: This really should have resolved 11 days ago, yet I haven't gotten around to resolving it yet, which is a bit of a problem. So I'm going to propose a resolution now. When I originally created this market, I thought of it as having a low-ish probability - maybe 15%. The evidence I had seen at the time suggested that IQ measured something fairly central to intelligence, but also that g is not the whole story for intelligence. But I wasn't sure, and so I wanted to use this market to elicit better information. Unfortunately, I didn't elicit much, so my probability stayed at around 15%. Part of the point was to come up with a more definite resolution by eliciting information, but that didn't really happen, so to better come up with a resolution, I've been researching this on and off for a while after the close. As mentioned in the comments below, I had had a cached thought that IQ and informally assessed intelligence had a correlation of around 0.5 or so. Upon closer investigation, it's somewhat more complicated than that. IQ and informally assessed intelligence seems to have a correlation of maybe 0.2; the 0.5ish number instead seems to come from IQ and informally assessed intellectual orientation. For instance,  this study  finds an 0.4ish correlation between IQ and the personality trait \"Intellect\", which is  particularly characterized by using fancy words . So from this angle on things, the evidence for IQ correlating well with commonsense notions of intelligence is much weaker than I had cached, due to not inspecting the details and being properly critical about them. If we based things on that alone, I should probably un-update away from IQ and resolve this market to a low number. HOWEVER, for unrelated reasons (I wanted to examine whether IQ tests are biased against black people in their choice of task focus), I also ended up doing a different survey to better investigate how people think of intelligence, where I asked people to name some examples of things they had done which require intelligence, encouraging people to pick the broadest difference of intelligence they believed in. The results from this survey were in line with my prior maximum likelihood, but they narrowed down my uncertainty in a way that partly updated in favor of IQ. If this was an ordinary market, I would probably resolve this to NA due to weird contradictory evidence and unclear resolution. But since I explicitly stated in the criteria that I would assign it to the probability that I personally assign (with the implied understanding being that it's just my opinion and not guaranteed to be correct), I'm instead going to resolve it to PROB. And I think the PROB I pick is 25%. I'll wait at least 24h before resolving so people have a chance to comment.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Gah, I keep typing up half a comment making a case for the market to be resolved in some way, then checking up on the details and getting dissatisfied with the available data. Kind of surprising how poorly studied this sort of question seems to be, considering how much drama there has been over the validity of IQ tests.\n---\n[Date]: 04-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: (...) When we fit an ability model to (IQ, GPA, SA), we have to consider the causal relations. The real relationship is probably something like this: The interpretation of \u03bb_GPA and \u03bb_SA are the same as before, but \u03bb_IQ has split into two variables, L_IQ representing the accuracy with which the IQ test measures general cognitive abilities, and e_g which represents the degree to which general cognitive abilities contribute to scholastic knowledge. In particular, this means that our previous estimate for the accuracy of the IQ test is an  underestimate . And remember, the lower the accuracy of a test, the higher the accuracy-adjusted correlations are, so if the accuracy estimate is biased downwards, that means the accuracy-adjusted correlations are biased upwards. When I said to adjust for the accuracy of the IQ test, I specified that it should be with respect to the g factor, i.e. the L_IQ part of this chain. The L_IQ part of the accuracy can be quantified using the \"omega hierarchical\" notion I brought up elsewhere in the comments. According to  this study,  the omega hierarchical for WISC-R is something like 0.81-0.85, which suggests we take a L_IQ = sqrt(0.83) = 0.91 as our estimate for the accuracy of the IQ test. As a first pass, this very much reins in our estimate of the accuracy of IQ tests as a measure of intelligence. Before, we estimated them to have an accuracy of 0.53 \/ (0.64 * 0.85) = 0.97, but now we would estimate them as having an accuracy of 0.53 \/ (0.91 * 0.85) = 0.69, which is within the 0.5-0.7 range that I originally described as my expectation for the market. Since this is less than the 0.8 I described as a threshold, this suggests that the market should resolve NO. EXCEPT... yes, we've seen how the naive approach underestimated the accuracy of the IQ tests, but surely the naive approach was also wrong about the accuracy of the mothers? Yep! In particular, the naive approach  overestimates  the accuracy of the mothers, which biases the adjusted correlation  downwards . To estimate the accuracy of the mother's evaluations of their children's intelligence, we looked at the correlation between their ratings of their children's intelligence in an absolute quantitative manner, versus in a percentile manner. This may very well adjust for certain kinds of error, such as lack of familiarity with the ways they were asked about the children's intelligence. However, it does not adjust for other kinds of error which are consistent for the mothers, such as idiosyncratic definitions of intelligence, or biases towards their own children, or similar. A primary way personality psychologists know for identifying this type of measurement error is to ask multiple raters, and this is also the method I suggested in the OP, so it forms the Schelling point for how to estimate the error. Unfortunately, this study only asked about the mothers' views, so we'll have to go beyond the study to estimate further. This is in fact the thing I was most uncertain about when I made the original post, so I would love additional input. One line of evidence I have is  this paper : ... which finds that people agree about how intelligent people are about as much as they agree about just about any other personality trait, with a few exceptions (emotional, talkative, quiet and dominant achieving higher agreement, I assume because they are particularly obvious). Unfortunately this does not measure estimated intelligence in the same way that the study of mother's estimates does, so the quantities are not directly transferable. ... I need to go prepare dinner now. But the basic summary of what I'd write next is that I am still uncertain about what exactly the relation is. Somewhere along the line I picked up the idea that IQ tests correlate at like 0.5 with perceived intelligence, and that different raters agree with each others about perceived intelligence at a rate which suggests that perceived intelligence has an accuracy of 0.77. If we use these numbers as our accuracy of perceived intelligence, then this gives us an IQ test accuracy of 0.5 \/ (0.91 * 0.77) = 0.71, which again is not enough for the market to resolve YES. However, I cannot immediately think of where I picked up this idea, and I don't want to resolve the market NO without a source, so the resolution will have to wait for a bit.\n---\n[Date]: 04-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: So, to an extent this market is a bit of a failure, because I had hoped it would stimulate some discourse about what we mean by intelligence or how measurement works, but not much has happened beyond the comments I have written. Still, I should obviously resolve the market, and hopefully my idea about how to resolve it will stimulate some discussion. When I created the market, I proposed the following method for resolving it: This still seems like a reasonable approach to me, at least as a first pass (see the various discussions in the comments in the market to learn more about specific details of my thoughts on it), though I am open to alternatives (as I hinted at in the market description and later explicitly said in the comments, I am open to arguments that this is the wrong way to think about the question, though this sort of forms a Schelling point for how to resolve the market if in doubt). One study that was semi-privately sent to me after creating this prediction market is  Mothers' Accuracy in Predicting Their Children's IQs: Its Relationship to Antecedent Variables, Mothers' Academic Achievement Demands, and Children's Achievement.  It is not a perfect study, but I think it is worth going in-depth into this study so I can teach some ways of analyzing the issue. The study itself is available on sci-hub, but the most important part of the study is this correlation matrix (showing how the variables that were measured in the study are related to each other): In particular, the #IQ column is centrally important, as it represents mother's estimates for their children's IQs, and the IQ row is also centrally important, as it represents the IQ scores of the children on the WISC-R IQ test. We might think of the mother's IQ estimates as representing the mother's notion of how intelligent their children are, in which case we see a correlation of 0.53 between mother's estimates and children's IQ, indicating that IQ is a nontrivial factor in intelligence, but that it is not the dominant factor, and therefore implying that the market should resolve NO (since it is less than the 0.8 that I proposed as a threshold). However, that conclusion would be premature, because of measurement error. It seems easy to imagine that certain parts of the measurement went wrong. For instance a single question about the children's numeric IQ scores might be hard to answer for people who don't properly understand how normal distributions work, or it might be that some mothers have idiosyncratic definitions of intelligence, or so on. Such a case would suppress the correlation between IQ and estimated intelligence. If r_{g, IQ} is the correlation between IQ tests and the \"true trait\" that IQ tests measure, r_{g, int} is the correlation between the true \"true IQ\" and the consensus notion of intelligence (i.e. the quantity we are interested in for this market), and r_{int, est} is the correlation between \"true intelligence\" and mother's estimates of intelligence, and r_{IQ, est} is the correlation between IQ and mother's estimates, then we'd often have something like r_{IQ, est} = r_{g, IQ} *  r_{g, int} * r_{int, est}. The meaning of these variables may be kind of confusing, so see the diagram below. (Generally when you see causal networks like this, you can estimate the expected correlation between two nodes by multiplying up the effects along the paths between the nodes, and then adding the paths together. If you want to look up the technical details, the term to get into is \"path analysis\" or \"structural equation modelling\".) If hypothetically we say that r_{g, IQ} = r_{int, est} = 0.73, then we can solve to get r_{g, int} = r_{IQ, est} \/ (r_{g, IQ} *  r_{int, est}) = 0.53 \/ (0.73 *  0.73) = 0.99. By the criteria mentioned previously, that would get the market resolved to YES, except the 0.73 number was totally made up, so it's not to be taken too seriously. But it gives us an important lesson: in order to fairly evaluate the question, we need to put some thought into measurement error. And perhaps counterintuitively, for a given observed correlation (e.g. the 0.53 number above), the less accurate the measurements are, the stronger the error-adjusted correlation is. This is essentially because measurement error makes it harder to see effects, so if you can see an effect despite strong measurement error, the effect itself must be really strong. Estimating measurement error is kind of a headscratcher. If you don't know the true value for a measurement, then how can you know how accurate it is? The usual approach in psychometrics is to make multiple measurements that are hopefully independent conditional on the true value getting measured, and then assuming these measurements correlate due to the true accuracy of the test, while the unique variance is the measurement error. This approach can be somewhat criticized, and again I'm open to debate about it, but it's the one I wrote in the original market criteria, so it's the one I will go with as a Schelling point for this issue. Let's start with measuring the accuracy of the IQ test. There are various studies that provide ways of learning about it more straightforwardly, but let's instead fit a one of the simplest models for measurement error, the latent factor model, as a learning exercise. In the study, in addition to IQ, there were two other tests of cognitive abilities: grade point average (GPA) and the Stanford achievement test (SA). Unlike IQ, GPA and SA are meant to measure what you've learned in school, so they are not technically the same thing. However, in practice they are correlated and people often use one as a proxy for the others, so just hypothetically to play around, let's pretend that they are all measures of the same thing, and see what we can learn. The latent factor model assumes that each variable (IQ, GPA, SA) has a \"factor loading\" (\u03bb_IQ, \u03bb_GPA, \u03bb_SA) representing the degree to which they correlate with a shared latent variable (which I suppose we can call Ability or something...). The correlations between any two of the variables should then be the product of their loadings. So for instance the correlation between IQ and GPA should be \u03bb_IQ * \u03bb_GPA. This gives us three equations (\u03bb_IQ * \u03bb_GPA = 0.5, \u03bb_IQ * \u03bb_SA = 0.61, \u03bb_GPA * \u03bb_SA = 0.74) for three unknown variables, which we can solve to obtain e.g. \u03bb_IQ = sqrt(r_{IQ, GPA} * r_{IQ, SA}\/r_{GPA, SA}) = sqrt(0.5*0.61\/0.74) = 0.64. And similarly \u03bb_GPA = 0.78, \u03bb_SA = 0.95. So one accuracy estimate we can use for the IQ test is 0.64. We'll evaluate later whether this is a  good  accuracy estimate, but for now let's consider how to estimate the accuracy of the mother's evaluations of their children's IQs. The obvious choice would be to use the latent factor model again, but we run into the difficulty that there are only two intelligence estimate variables (#IQ and percent IQ), which leaves us with 1 equation and 2 unknowns, making the system underdetermined. One neat approximation one can do in this sort of case is to assume that the two variables are equally accurate (two loadings\/\u03bbs are the same), in which case one can estimate \u03bb = sqrt(r) where r is the correlation. This would give us \u03bb = sqrt(0.57) = 0.75. Another approach is to pick some additional third variable to throw in, e.g. we could pick actual IQ. This gives us \u03bb_#IQ = sqrt(0.57*0.53\/0.41) = 0.85, and \u03bb_%IQ = sqrt(0.57*0.41\/0.53) = 0.66. So, if we estimate the accuracy of the IQ test as \u03bb_IQ = 0.64, and we estimate the accuracy of the mother's estimates as 0.85, then what happens to the correlation of 0.53 as we adjust it for measurement error? We get 0.53 \/ (0.64 * 0.85) = 0.97, which is clearly above the threshold of 0.8. So does this mean the market should resolve YES? Nope, because this was just an exercise in how I go through the numbers. It turns out that these numbers can't literally be correct. For instance if the SA test has an accuracy of 0.95 of measuring the same thing that IQ tests measure at an accuracy of 0.64, then it seems like we should expect mother's evaluations of children's intelligence to correlate 46% more with the SA test than with the IQ test. Yet instead they seem to correlate about equally closely. What went wrong? What went wrong is that we just grabbed the most convenient available notion of measurement error, without thinking through whether it was the appropriate one for the task. Some notions of measurement error may be context-specific, or may be limited to being upper bounds or lower bounds, and if we don't take this into account, we may bias the calculations. So let's be a bit more careful in the analysis: (...to be continued in a subcomment because I am running out of comment space...)\n---\n[Date]: 04-07-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I agree with a lot of what you are saying. Just to clarify, my comment was specifically responding to Boojum's argument that a group difference is sufficient to prove that they measure intelligence, not meant to cover intelligence measurement more generally. (I plan on writing a top-level comment on this market soon where I give my current views and invite for debate before resolving. However it will take a bit to write and I have a few other things to do, so it won't happen immediately.) \"Still, it makes perfect sense to describe rulers as good measures of tallness, and showing their ability to distinguish 'tall' and 'short' people to be an argument in their favor.\" I think there are various claims to measuring tallness with varying levels of strength: IIRC think the correlation between ruler measurements and actual height is something like r=0.97 (there's some interesting questions I won't get into yet about how this sort of number comes up), which makes them excel at properties 1-3 and perform OK on property 4. (And they also satisfy a bunch more properties, which are really fascinating to think about but not so relevant to the question). However, Boojum's argument would only show that rulers satisfy the first criterion, not the other ones (since his argument is only a direct test of the first one). Of course you are right that Boojum's argument is evidence of the latter ones, but only because it rules out truly astrological measurements, not because this is a serious part of an incremental research program to show that it satisfies the stronger properties you'd expect of many measurements. An additional complication comes in if you want to use a ruler to measure e.g. weight via height as a proxy. Let's say that weight is determined by height, adiposity and muscularity. You can use a ruler measurement to get you an accurate idea of a person's height, but their height will only be imperfectly correlated with their weight, so again we have similar thresholds of measurement quality to the above, but with different interpretations: Looking it up, the within-sex correlation between weight and height is something like 0.5. This implies that we definitely have property 1, and kind of have property 2. (Interesting TIL from this: it might be hard for a ruler to both satisfy property 4 wrt. height and satisfy property 2 wrt. weight, because they are both close to the same threshold.) A thing I should add: There's an interesting question of how strong properties a measurement method must have before it is considered a real measurement. I don't think it would be considered acceptable to be missing properties 1 and 2 (though I would be open to hearing arguments, e.g. if there are commonly accepted measurement which lack those properties then I might change my mind). I'm pretty sure IQ tests satisfy properties 1 and 2, so I expect IQ tests to be better measures of intelligence than rulers are of weight. It gets more complicated with properties 3 and 4. I don't think anyone claims IQ tests satisfy property 4, and I don't think many people would require measurements to satisfy property 4 in general. It's a very strong property that we only get with some of our best measurement methods. So the controversy is mostly about property 3. The requirements for property 3 might be a YMMV thing where people disagree a lot. If my opinion on property 3 is very controversial, then I might change my mind or run a poll or something to make the resolution more aligned with what people think. But my current thoughts are: \"Speaking of the correlation between IQ and intelligence is somewhat akin to speaking of the correlation between height and the length your measuring tape measures when measuring your height--one is simply the test to measure the other.\" We can still speak of the correlation between the test and the property, though? The simplest variant of this would be if you have some very accurate test that you can use as a ground truth. For example, I once saw a study investigating the accuracy of self-reported weight, by having a bunch of people report their weight and then get weighted in the doctor's office for comparison. If you don't have a perfect ground-truth test, then it is more difficult to estimate the correlation between the test and the thing getting tested, but that doesn't stop people from trying. The thing I see people most commonly cite is the test-retest reliability, i.e. if you get measured twice, how accurate highly correlated is that. This corresponds to the r^2, and for high-quality IQ tests it's something like 0.9. Which in turn would suggest that the r is something like 0.95, except test-retest reliability is sort of an astrological notion of validity. (Literally! Your star sign presumably has a test-retest reliability of 1, but that doesn't make star sign a valid measure of anything.) IQ tests commonly claim to measure the g factor, a characteristic which makes you better or worse at a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Psychometricians have come up with a notion called omega hierarchical for quantifying the validity of a measure of such a factor. Roughly speaking it works by using the correlations between performance on different tasks to measure the degree to which different tasks load onto the g factor, and then computing the accuracy of a given test battery from the loadings of the tests in the battery. When I wrote the question, I had the impression that the omega hierarchical for a good IQ tests is something like 0.86, which corresponds to a correlation with g of sqrt(0.86) = 0.93. I'll probably double-check this before making a serious case for resolving the market, though.\n---\n[Date]: 04-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \"Ask yourself this question: would the average smart person perform better than the average dumb person on an IQ test. If you're answer is yes, resolve as YES\"  Variants of this argument are valid under some circumstances but not all circumstances. I think it is worthwhile to analyze what circumstances it is relevant to understand things well. First, imagine if the people we'd classify as smart score an average IQ of 105, while the people we'd classify as dumb score an average IQ of 95. Does that make IQ a measure of intelligence? I would say no, because there is like 75% overlap between the groups. It has an error rate of 25%, which is better than the the rate of 50% that you'd get by chance, but still very high. So it's not enough to have a difference in IQ based on intelligence. Rather they must in some sense be big. For instance, if everyone can be classified into \"smart\" or \"dumb\", and smart people consistently score higher in IQ than dumb people, with something like a 30+ point gap between their averages, then it starts looking reasonable. And yes, I could easily believe that if you take people who are known for being smart, and people who are known for being dumb, then they would have basically non-overlapping IQ ranges. So that means I should resolve the question to \"yes\", right? Not so fast. This argument is likely valid if intelligence forms a binary smart\/dumb distribution, but are you right about it doing that? I don't think so, with several pieces of evidence: Suppose therefore for greater realism that intelligence is not binary, but instead e.g. normally distributed. What then goes wrong with your approach of comparing people who are smart to people who are dumb? Essentially, you will end up using different intelligence thresholds for smart vs dumb people, which will exaggerate the correlation between IQ and intelligence. For instance, suppose people develop a reputation for being smart when they are 2 standard deviations above the mean of intelligence, and people develop a reputation for being dumb when they are 2 standard deviations below the mean in intelligence. In that case, if r^2 is the variance of intelligence that is due to g, then smart people would be expected to have a higher g-score of around 4 r^2, which means that if e.g. variation in intelligence is only 50% due to g, then smart people would still be 2 standard deviations higher in g than dumb people, making them pass (my modified version of) your test, yet still making this market resolve NO.\n---\n[Date]: 02-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: And I agree that interests seem to matter a lot.\n---\n[Date]: 02-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think it's tricky to say much about this from a psychometric perspective because generating deep insights doesn't lend itself well to measurement. (Psychometrics tends to be very data-driven, by the way.) So what I have to say is going to be speculative. One thing to remember is that IQ tests measure general abilities. This matters a lot for the case of e.g. generating insights into physics, because I bet Einstein and all other physicists have a bunch of specific characteristics that make them way better at physics than their IQ would suggest on its own (both better at being clever and better at generating deep insights). For instance they have done a lot of physics problems and had a lot of physics education. I expect that these specific characteristics make them both better at quick, clever, superficial solutions to physics questions, and at long, wise, deep insights in physics. Though there is some decorrelation (e.g. maybe wide experience leads to more deep insight). But here we talk about cleverness and deep insights in the abstract, rather than specifically to physics. This requires some way to abstract away the specific topic of physics. For instance one could use the same approach that IQ tests use, of considering a general factor that permits deep insights across many topics. But I think that's hard to even investigate the existence of, because deep insights are too rare and difficult to measure.\n---\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: This may also be of interest:  Are smart people's personal experiences biased against general intelligence?\n---\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  One of Taleb's most repeated criticisms is that the correlations involved with IQ are very low in terms of information content. The core thing information is designed to measure is how long \"messages\" can be sent through a channel. So basically in this critique, Taleb is saying that if you had a message you wanted to send, encoded it into a number x between 70 and 130, took a smart person (e.g. IQ 130), gave them a precisely controlled amount of brain damage to set their IQ to x, and then transported the person to where you wanted to send the message to, and had them perform work, and decoded the message from the quality of their work, then the fact that IQ carries ~no information means that you can't really use this as a protocol for sending messages of any nontrivial length. I agree with Taleb that precisely delivering brain damage and then decoding that brain damage using work performance is a terrible message-passing protocol and that you'd be better of using the internet or something. However, I have never seen a fan of IQ advocate for this message-passing protocol, and so I think his argument is absolutely ridiculous. Another quite repeated criticism is that IQ isn't a measure of real-world performance but instead of \"intellectual yet idiot\" tendencies. I would agree that IQ isn't a measure of real-world performance but instead of the g factor. However, I don't see any reason to think that the g-factor leads to idiocy in the real world; instead it seems like the g-factor is useful across many contexts, including heavy-tailed contexts such as trading. Of course the g-factor isn't  everything , it's just one important factor. He also had a bunch of other criticisms than those, but I can't address all of them here. \n---\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Prior to checking the distinction: A priori I don't necessarily care about either, because while formal psychometri* training educates people out of some common misconceptions, I have the impression that it also educates people  into  some strange approaches. Of course you asked about the distinction between psychometrist and psychometrician, not about my opinion on psychometri*ses vs normies. I don't know what the distinction refers to. If I had to guess the second is someone who designs and administers psychological tests such as IQ tests and personality tests, because I feel like I've heard that word used in that context, whereas I don't think I've heard the word psychometrist. Maybe psychometrists work in psychophysics or something. I would have assumed they were synonymous if not for your question. After checking the distinction: Ok, so psychometrists are the ones administering the tests, psychometricians are the ones designing and administering the tests. This might reveal my ivory tower tendencies since I've mostly read into the latter. I would probably be inclined to trust psychometrists relatively more on questions related to test administration (such as \"are there sometimes kids in school who don't put in enough effort to do well on tests even though they could?\") and psychometricians relatively more on questions related to psychometric theory (such as \"are cognitive abilities multidimensional?\").\n---\n[Date]: 02-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Hmm not much evidence has been bought up for this market.

Test-retest correlations for full-scale IQ is something like 0.9, some studies claim that the g-factors of different IQ test batteries correlate at like 0.99 (though I've been meaning to look into whether they are making a specific methodological error and consider it plausible that they actually \"only\" correlate at 0.9ish), etc.. This study found that the g factor had a correlation of 0.79 with the general factor underlying video game performance:  https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0160289618301521 I should also note that it's not that all of the aspects of intelligence have to correlate well with IQ in order for the market to resolve positively. It is sufficient if overall intelligence correlates well with IQ. Like you could imagine that intelligence is made out of 5 independent factors, each of which correlates at 0.45 with IQ. If that is the case, then the market would still resolve yes, because that would mean that  overall  intelligence has a correlation of 1 with IQ, even though each of the 5 independent factors only has a correlation of 0.45.\n---\n[Date]: 02-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  It's not quite right that it doesn't matter what mental activity you test.

The API is preferable since setting temperature to 0 will allow the judge to replicate your responses, but if your prompt has a high success rate ChatGPT could also be accepted. See the definitions of \"reliably\" and \"occasionally\" below for details on computing the success rate if more precision is needed. Model must be produced by OpenAI, so finetuned variants would not count.\n\nSee \"Related markets\" below for variants that allow GPT-3.5, finetuned models, and that only need to solve a single puzzle.\n\nEasy-rated Sudoku puzzle means a puzzle classified as easy by any reputable Sudoku site or puzzle generator. This market plans to use the LA Times(Sudoku - Free daily Sudoku games from the Los Angeles Times (latimes.com)) for judging, but I maintain the option to use a different Sudoku generator.\n\nFixed-prompt means that everything except the Sudoku puzzle provided to GPT-4 remains the same. The prompt may provide GPT-4 with instructions, but these instructions must not change for each puzzle. A solution must be found within 50 turns. Multimodal support is allowed to be used. The operator cannot give information to GPT-4 beyond the initial puzzle, so their inputs must be static. (e.g. just saying \"continue\" if ChatGPT runs out of output space and stops).\n\nFormal definition of Solution\n\nA Sudoku Template is any string with exactly 81 substitution points. Such template can be combined with 81 digits 1-9 or a Placeholder value to produce a Rendered Sudoku. The placeholder can be any string - including \"0\", \".\",  or \"_\" - but must be a specific string and identical each time. The substitution points do not need to be in any specific order: An inverted or flipped puzzle would also be allowed by using a template with substitutions in inverted or flipped order.\n\nAn image rendering of the initial puzzle would also be a valid Rendered Sudoku .\n\nChat Completion API entry is a pair (tag, message), where tag is one of \"system\", \"user\", \"assistant\", and message is any UTF-8 string. When multimodal GPT-4 is released, message can also be an image.\n\nA Turn is a pair (entries, response), where entries is a list of Chat Completion API entries and response is the UTF-8 encoded string that GPT-4 generates.\n\nA Transition Rule maps one list of entries to another list of entries, using the primitive operations:\n\nRemove entry at fixed index(from beginning or end)\n\nInsert a fixed message at a fixed index(from beginning or end).\n\nInsert a rendered Sudoku created from the initial Sudoku puzzle at a fixed index(from beginning or end). The fixed prompt is allowed to contain multiple renderings of the same puzzle.\n\nInsert the GPT-4 response to the input entry list to any fixed index(from beginning or end). You can use either the default GPT-4 response length(i.e. whenever it emits an <|im_end|> token), or can specify an exact token count up to the native context size of the model. It is allowed to make multiple API requests, and to retry requests that respond with errors, as long as the successful requests are all unconditionally concatenated into a single response and the inputs + response fits within the model's context. You cannot apply any other transition rules until the entire response is generated. The \"output tokens\" of the OpenAI don't matter - only the context size; so the 128k GPT-4 Turbo can be chunked to produce either a fixed number of tokens or the model can choose to stop at any point up to 128k.\n\nExample: You have 2,000 tokens of input and are using the 32k model. If you specify \"32,000\" as your size here, you're allowed to keep querying the API sending the entire context + all previous responses until you get exactly 30,000 tokens of output. These should all be concatenated into a single entry.\n\nExample: You're using GPT-4 Turbo which is a 128k context model, and have a 12k prompt. Using the \"finish_reason\" in the API response, the model would be allowed to generate up to 116k tokens using the maximum 4k output tokens each time.\n\nThe GPT-4 response can be tagged \"user\", \"assistant\", or \"system\" when later resent to GPT-4, as long as this choice doesn't depend on the message.\n\nTruncate an entry at a fixed token index(index is from beginning or end, and truncation can start from beginning or end). You can use characters for testing, but judging will use \"cl100k_base\" tokens.\n\nA Fixed-prompt is any sequence of transition rules.\n\nThe Operator is the human or program that is executing a fixed-prompt against the OpenAI API.\n\nThen a Solution for the purposes of this market is a fixed-prompt satisfying all of:\n\n\"initial Sudoku puzzle\" is bound to a specific rendered Sudoku.\n\nThe transition rules are applied for 50 turns to get a maximum of 50 GPT-4 responses.\n\nThe operator scanning for the first thing that subjectively looks like a solved Sudoku puzzle in those responses and then stopping, is able to input the solution into a Sudoku checking tool and confirms that it is a solution to the initial Sudoku puzzle.\n\n\"Subjectively looks like\" refers to parsing a puzzle from a string into a normal form, and is approximately \"turn number-dependent regular expression with named capture groups\". I choose not to specify it because I'm not 100% sure what regex generalizations allow useful compute and want to retain the possibility of rejecting them.\n\nExamples\n\nThe simplest valid pattern is:\n\n(\"User\", <some initial prompt>)\n\n(\"User\", <provide puzzle>)\n\n(\"Assistant\", response 0)\n\n(\"User\", \"continue\") ;; or any other fixed input\n\n(\"Assistant\", response 1)\n\n(\"User\", \"continue\")\n\n....\n\n(\"User\", \"continue\")\n\n(\"Assistant\", solution)\n\nWith at most 50 \"Assistant\" entries(50 turns). The only \"dynamic\" input here is entry #2 which has the puzzle, and the rest is ChatGPT's responses. So this counts as a \"fixed prompt\" solution. You're allowed to insert more prompts into the chain after the puzzle, as long as the decision to include them or their contents do not depend on the puzzle. For example, you might have a prompt that causes ChatGPT to expand the puzzle into a set of logical constraints. You're allowed to drop sections from the chain when sending context to GPT-4 , as long as the decision to drop does not depend on the contents of any section.\n\nCandidate solutions will be converted to code and run using a script(Mira-public\/manifold-sudoku (github.com)). You are not required to interact with this script when submitting a solution, but @Mira will attempt to use it to judge your solution so it may help in understanding the format.\n\nLanguage modeling capabilities means that GPT-4 is not allowed to use any external tools, plugins, recursive invocations, or resources to aid in solving the Sudoku puzzle. It must rely solely on its language modeling capabilities and the context provided within the prompt. This is less relevant when using the API or Playground, and more relevant to using ChatGPT.\n\nReliably means the prompt succeeds at least 80% of the time, on freshly-generated puzzles. Occasionally means the prompt succeeds at least 20% of the time, on freshly-generated puzzles. I will run any proposed solution against 5 puzzles, with more testing to be done if it succeeds at least once or if there is disagreement in the comments about whether it meets a threshold(perhaps I got very unlucky). More testing means choosing a fixed pool of puzzles and calculating an exact percentage. I currently plan to choose \"all easy-rated Sudoku puzzles in January 2024 from LA Times\" as my pool. Since judging solutions requires me spending real money on API calls, I may optionally require collateral to be posted: $10 of mana(\u1e401000) for quick validation, and $100 of mana(\u1e4010k) for extended validation. Collateral will be posted as a subsidy to an unlisted market that resolves NA if the candidate passes testing, or collected equal to Mira's API costs if not. Anyone can post collateral for a candidate, not just the submitter. Detailed testing will be done with the API set to temperature 0, not ChatGPT.\n\n@Mira as market creator will trade in this market, but commits not to post any solution, or to provide prompts or detailed prompting techniques to other individuals. So if it resolves YES or 50%, it must be the work of somebody other than Mira.\n\nExample Puzzles\n\nFrom Sudoku - New York Times Number Puzzles - The New York Times (nytimes.com) on March 28. 2023, \"Easy\"\n\n210000487\n\n800302091\n\n905071000\n\n007590610\n\n560003002\n\n401600700\n\n039007000\n\n700100026\n\n100065009\n\nSolution:\n\n213956487\n\n876342591\n\n945871263\n\n327594618\n\n568713942\n\n491628735\n\n639287154\n\n754139826\n\n182465379\n\nRelated Markets\n\nMain market: @\/Mira\/will-a-prompt-that-enables-gpt4-to \n\nGPT-4 any puzzle: @\/Mira\/m100-subsidy-will-gpt4-solve-any-fr-c5b090d547d1 \n\nGPT-3.5 any puzzle, no finetuning: @\/Mira\/will-gpt35-solve-any-freshlygenerat \n\nGPT-3.5 any puzzle, finetuning allowed: @\/Mira\/will-finetuned-gpt35-solve-any-fres \n\nGroup including other related markets: https:\/\/manifold.markets\/questions?topic=gpt4-sudoku-challenge-2023\n\nEdit History\n\nMar 26, 2:53pm: Will a prompt that enables GPT-4 to solve easy Sudoku puzzles be found?

If you can do this and such linear recursion uses only the described transition rules, it would be accepted.  Any prompt in the fixed-prompt format should be accepted - I've tried to be careful accounting for hidden sources of compute that would allow a cheesy win, so the description can be relied on as a lower bound for what's accepted. The 50 turn limit is less of a concern with 128k context, since you're not restricted to the 4k API limit. So converting the recursion structure may be more feasible than it initially sounds. The main difficulty is keeping the error rate low, and if this technique helps with that it may be usable.\n---\n[Date]: 12-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I checked 10 for solvability, and tested 4.

So 50% success rate when the prompt is eligible to run * 60% = 30%. Supposedly even a single additional technique would make all of the easy puzzles solvable. And since we went from 0% to 50% pretty quickly, the next one might be 80% and we might get lucky on easier puzzles in January.\n---\n[Date]: 12-12-2023\n[Likes] 5\n[Text]:  I'll allow it because the contest is almost over.

Here's a transcript for the December 7 LA Times puzzle: https:\/\/github.com\/Mira-public\/manifold-sudoku\/blob\/main\/transcripts\/emily-3\/emily-2.034720009608000250700900003910000765020300800070009300080001504001003000509402030.sudoku_log.txt On the 16th turn, it outputs: Even though my code says it is solved, I also punched it into a  website  to check and it says it's a valid solution. This is a permutation of the original puzzle, but I'm inclined to count it because parsing a solution should be the inverse of a Sudoku Template, which allows one to specify a permutation: Emily's solution acts on a 6-cycle, where every 2 turns the rows are shifted by 3. So the permutation is deterministic, does not depend on the contents of the puzzle, and can be matched to one of 3 Sudoku Templates depending only on the turn number. So I believe this counts as a valid solution. December 3: Had an error on turn 5, where it wrote a row with only 8 columns December 4: Unsolvable by Emily's technique December 5: Unsolvable December 6: Unsolvable December 7: Solved. I will do some more testing, on at least 5 puzzles that aren't unsolvable, so I won't resolve the 3 \"any puzzle\" markets just yet. This will also give people time to review this transcript, to see if I missed something. Here are the 8 stages of this puzzle being solved using Emily's technique, printed at the end of the transcript: These are intermediate Sudokus with more and more cells filled in, where the 81 cells are represented using 81 digits 0-9(0 being a placeholder).\n---\n[Date]: 12-09-2023\n[Likes] 6\n[Text]: I believe I have a solve on the October 1 puzzle I was using to test my script.

I believe it will be the \"production\" GPT 4 Turbo(the current model is \"gpt-4-1106-preview\" and \"gpt-4\" does not alias it by default) and OpenAI staff have been working on regressions such as the \"laziness\" issues we discovered soon after DevDay. So while this isn't certain, you might get one last chance for a model upgrade right before this market closes.

There's some minor changes needed to my script for GPT-4 Turbo, and I needed to wait a couple days for fresh puzzles to resolve any markets anyways. It has neither failed nor succeeded, so people shouldn't make any update about this solution yet. I'll try to have this tested by Sunday on at least 5 fresh ones. Emily has been careful to provide exact tokens for all her prompts, simulation functions, transcripts, and most of the code she's been using. So it still seems likely to me that this will replicate.  There's an \"aiworkshop\" module in your script. It looks like a thin wrapper around openai's library. It's a small thing so I haven't commented on it before, but it does mean I can't run the code exactly as-is. Is this public anywhere?

If you try with a freshly-generated puzzle, such as published in the LA Times newspaper, you'll likely see that it doesn't generalize. So far, nobody has produced a solution that reliably solves even a single freshly-generated Sudoku puzzle.

I suspect   will be happy to cover as many attempts as needed, though.  I thought 90% was too high after my first replication failed, since it needs an 80% solve rate for this to resolve YES. I was thinking 75% was reasonable if it solved 1\/5 since the market would likely resolve 50%, and now maybe 60% would be reasonable after it failed 8-in-a-row but with a lot of focused effort still being put in. 50% if OpenAI DevDay doesn't announce anything useful. I had limit orders up to re-enter, but the market converged to my own opinion so I'm currently at a 0 shares position. I would still be buying YES at percentages below these.\n---\n[Date]: 10-24-2023\n[Likes] 11\n[Text]: Emily's already noticed, but I did test the second prompt against 8 puzzles: 7 from the LA times and 1 from the NY times. Transcripts are  here . None of them succeeded. Many failed in the first couple turns, though there a couple runs that made it 30+ steps in before making an error. Errors I noticed include: Regarding the very large outputs, I'm wondering if I should consider it a \"failure to return a response\", since GPT-4 isn't choosing to end the response by generating an  <|im_end|>  token, and allow a retry just the same as a failed API call. Especially since it's non-deterministic and the second try usually returns something reasonable. Regarding non-determinism: For the \"will GPT-4 solve any puzzle at all?\", I'll allow retries to count. But for this main market, I will only test each puzzle once and whatever result will be counted YES\/NO. Even retrying API-terminated responses didn't get me a successful solve though. I was considering running the prompt #1 for 10 puzzles, that had only made a single mistake when I tested it, because I really wanted to get you guys a successful solve(especially after this market got pushed up to 90%...). But I think I'm going to wait until November 6(OpenAI Devday!) for possible price\/performance improvements.\n---\n[Date]: 10-16-2023\n[Likes] 25\n[Text]: I've input Emily's prompt into my script, rerun, and get a divergence that fails to solve the October 5 puzzle.

I have an update on   ' solution. This covers the October 3 puzzle that looks like: I've added   ' prompt to my judging script(   https:\/\/github.com\/Mira-public\/manifold-sudoku\/blob\/main\/solutions\/emily\/emily.py  ) and a  transcript  in Emily's logfile format for easy diff'ing. My transcript diverges from Emily's, never solves the puzzle, and puts the puzzle into an unsolvable state by incorrectly writing a cell. The first minor difference is on  line 420  where Emily's original transcript has a slight error including \"5\" in the intersection of two sets. My replication GPT-4 doesn't make this mistake, and it could be caused by the line \"For each row we do the following calculations:\" from Prompt A being missing in Emily's transcript. Possibly a copy-paste error. It ends not mattering, because the response is truncated identically. The second difference - which does affect the future trace - is that on  line 790  of the original transcript, GPT-4 correctly excludes 6 as a candidate on row 2 column 6, while on  line 755  of my replication GPT-4 includes it as a candidate. This means Emily's GPT-4 is able to place an 8 in that cell, while mine remains undecided between 6 and 8. (The line numbers differ only because the first 35 lines of Emily's transcript are redundant.) However, in my replication, if you scroll to the very end of the file it does eventually place an 8 in that cell. So while this is a divergence and a missed opportunity, it is not the first incorrectly-placed cell. The first incorrect placement is between  line 12513  and  line 13000  where the line \"[1,3,9,6,4,7,5,2,0]\" should be \"[1,3,9,6,4,7,8,2,5]\". This is caused by: where 8 is incorrectly excluded from the top-right block candidates, leading to 5 being committed to the cell. I'm not entirely sure where it gets the [5,6,7] from.  line 12527  looks overly-truncated. The last mention of \"top_right_block_candidates\" is  \"block = top_right_block_candidates = [1,2,4,8]\"  which does include an 8. The above is exactly 300 tokens as instructed  here  . So it's possible that GPT-4 hallucinated some cells that were truncated(or copied them from the examples), and that raising the truncation tokens will cause this error to go away.  But Emily's prompt also uses most of the 8k context, so adding in another couple dozen might need some tokens removed elsewhere. You can replicate my log transcript using the command(from my Github's judging script): and then the \"outputs\/\" folder will have a \"sudoku_log\" file in emily's logging format. It can take up to 2 hours to finish a single test. So   , if this diagnosis sounds right to you, then it's probably going to have similar token truncation issues on other puzzles. So you might want to do a little bit of optimization to get this one running reproducibly before we extend testing out to more puzzles. I haven't tried running the prompt on any others yet.

They just have the \"chat\" fluff cut out so it follows instructions more reliably. If they had released an Instruct variant along with GPT-4, I probably would've settled on that for this contest. As it is, you're already predicting unreleased models since multimodal, larger context sizes, possibly the state management API, would all be allowed. But they're all the same model class, and should have similar reasoning capability.\n---\n[Date]: 09-22-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  An instruct model seems ideal for the Sudoku challenge, but I excluded 3.5 from the rules in this market months ago.

The API will timeout for any response size > 5k tokens but still charge you for the full generation. I think OpenAI intends for the context to mainly hold input, not to generate giant responses. This market is supposed to be a test of the model's capabilities, not of OpenAI's infrastructure. So I've amended the \"GPT-4 Response\" transition rule to allow multiple API requests to generate a single logical response, as long as the total token count is at or below the model's native size(8k or 32k). So if it helps you to generate 4k at a time rather than getting a timeout with 16k, this is allowed. This should be similar to what the model is doing anyways, when it generates a token at a time. As usual, you can't look the content of the response to decide when to stop generating. If you specify a token count, the pattern of API requests must generate a conversation that is exactly that many tokens(input + output), and the responses must be concatenated into a single entry. Splitting it up like this will still cost you more than doing it in one request, but if the requests weren't succeeding at all this is better than nothing. Hopefully the truncation rule helps with the costs a bit to make up for that.\n---\n[Date]: 08-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: If you're working on this, add your name to the list and buy shares in yourself.

I have added a transition rule allowing you to truncate a message at any fixed token index. This will save people a lot of money since you won't have to resend the analysis that GPT-4 did to arrive at a result, and can keep the result only.  Truncating at characters vs. tokens is unlikely to matter in practice if you're writing anything like normal prompts, but judging will need to count in tokens to be sure nobody sneaks certain computations in by strategically cutting tokens in half. GPT-4's tokenizer is \"cl100k_base\", which is different from both tokenizers on their  website . I considered allowing arbitrary message splitting, but it would allow using the context management operations as a task queue. So this change only allows truncation.\n---\n[Date]: 08-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  If that date is intended to be \"the day after the Sudoku market closes\", this market closes at the end of 2023 so you're off by a year.

This also answers   's question. You'll need to have GPT-4 insert the set of puzzle-specific variables. You can simulate the \"variable sharing\" by rendering the same puzzle 3 ways using different templates: By rows, by columns, and by blocks. And then getting GPT-4 to convert any placeholders to matching variables.\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  Thanks for posting this! You succeeded on the example prompt here, which should not be in GPT-4's training dataset. My initial read of your article is that the input representation and length are the only issues, so if your prompt can be improved and replicates on a new puzzle it could be the first prompt to resolve a few of these Sudoku markets positively. I'll probably add your fixed prompt to my judging script after that code is released, just to make sure that I didn't miss anything, and in case anybody else wants to try it out. ---  This is the part you're worried about? This would be allowed because the context management operations(delete\/insert messages at fixed points in the conversation) allow you to produce a similar effect using two conversation entries. You would be correct that it is technically disallowed to create this as a single message. ----- @VitorBosshard  Yeah, this input representation I wouldn't accept because it is a system of logical constraints, and that's too distant from the original Sudoku. This representation involves: 1. Allocating separate variables for each blank cell and 2. Sharing those variables between the row\/column\/block arrays. Sharing variables is I think normally difficult, but since each variable can appear at most 3 times and there are only 81 squares you can probably just have a long case-analysis prompt generate the constraints. And if somebody writes a 1-turn case analysis prompt, you can use the context operations to delete everything except the converted puzzle, insert the Sudoku-solving instructions as a fixed message, and proceed as usual. If these are the rows, this output format looks recognizably like a Sudoku, so I would accept it.\n---\n[Date]: 08-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yes, GPT-4 is allowed to guess the output or to predict a trace of the output of code.

I have 4 things to talk about: Discord Server I'm making a Discord server for this challenge in case it helps people organize their efforts. Anyone can join. Invite link  https:\/\/discord.gg\/Y6qvtB5xPD Recent Testing I spent about $20 yesterday testing some more candidate solutions, and so far no prompt has yet managed to solve a single freshly-generated Sudoku puzzle. I continue to think that this problem is solvable, and that it would merely take 3 days focused effort and at most $500 in API calls. OpenAI are supposed to announce a 90% GPT-4 cost reduction either later this year or early next year. My guess is by October, but don't bet too much money relying on that. If the cost comes down, that's 10x as much testing people would be willing to do and would make this much more likely to be solved. Testing your own Prompts If you would like to test your own prompts using the same script I'm using, you can clone this repository:  Mira-public\/manifold-sudoku ( github.com ) To test that you've set it up properly, use a command like: Which uses   's \"single forward pass\" prompt, invoking GPT-4 exactly once, to generate the output: It should generate the exact same output every time, for the same puzzle. Any prompt format accepted by this script would count, even unnatural-seeming prompts. And even a single positive example would resolve   as YES. You can browse the \"\/solutions\" subdirectory to see candidate solutions others have given, in case Python code is easier to read than my market description. Conflict of Interest Disclosure I have a lot of YES shares in this market, but I will not be attempting a solution for this market nor will I provide prompts or detailed prompting techniques to any others. It's bad optics for the market creator to drop a solution a couple weeks before the market closes after slowly accumulating a position all year, so this is a commitment not to do that. I may give out my API key or invite others to my OpenAI organization if they can't afford API costs. See   if you want to bet on my own attempt, which I would only do after this market resolves NO.

Past that, the rolling summarization and append-only context makes it harder for ChatGPT to keep focused on the task, and it starts guessing what it's supposed to do from what its own previous responses look like. Playground or API should be the same. I think they will be easier to keep GPT-4 on-track once you have a good prompt. To make ChatGPT perform similarly, I think you would need to replicate instructions onto the end of the conversation each turn and limit the length of outputs and instructions, since GPT-3.5 and 4 seem to struggle with precisely manipulating tokens further back from the end of the context. So if the primary instructions are at the beginning of the conversation, it will eventually stop reliably applying them. But all 3 should be equally capable tools.\n---\n[Date]: 05-05-2023\n[Likes] 5\n[Text]: I have a couple updates: It cost about $8 in API calls to run, and any future solutions I'll also judge using this script. If you have a GPT-4 enabled API key, you can test your own solutions using this script if you like; but you are not required to interact with my script in any way, as long as I can convert it to the \"fixed prompt\" format in the description. I do not recommend developing your solution using the API or this script: It seems API calls get the lowest priority, and can take up to 5 minutes to complete for token-heavy responses like Sudokus. Playground and ChatGPT seem to get higher priority. If you use the full 50 turns, it could take literally hours to run a single puzzle, and you would be rate-limited if you try to parallelize it across an entire 31-day set of puzzles...\n---\n[Date]: 05-03-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  API-based solutions will be run a single time, and I will post code that I will use for judging soon.

I do caution that this is not a purely predictive market: If you buy NO, it increases the prize pool for people to spend effort and money finding a solution. This is why I made the bounty so high, because this is a difficult problem that would automatically resolve NO if nobody found it worthwhile to solve it.\n---\n[Date]: 05-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  ChatGPT-based solutions that cannot be converted to API will be run a single time if extended testing is required.

The question doesn't mean anything when calling the API or using Playground, which give you full freedom of what to send. For ChatGPT, you are allowed to create a new conversation in which you begin by concatenating entries from the old conversation. However, be mindful of the \"fixed prompt\" rules. In particular, the phrase \"current game state\" is concerning because you're not allowed to extract the partially solved Sudoku and paste only that into a new window. You must copy an entire block(user or assistant) or nothing at all, and the decision cannot depend on reading the block. I would count \"total number of responses by ChatGPT\" as the 50. I suspect that your approach would be easily transferable to Playground once you get it working. So it would be a good way to develop a solution cost-effectively before testing with the API. If you do not have API access, I would recommend applying for the waitlist and trying Playground, which naturally lets you drop things from context without needing workarounds like this. (API\/Playground is also much more expensive, and will probably cost me $100 to do extended testing of any candidate against a pool of 31 puzzles. I'll also be releasing some code soon that I will be using to judge solutions, though it won't work for ChatGPT if your solution truly depended on it and didn't transfer over.)\n---\n[Date]: 05-03-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  Please test on freshly generated puzzles, like the link to the New York Times.\n---\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:   No plugins or external tools like code executors.

One market is for May and one will run all year.   's question below gave me this idea. I believe that this is a solvable problem considering that GPT-4 has demonstrated the ability to trace program executions, and Sudoku solvers could be a program that it traces; but I originally estimated that it would take me at least 3 days of focused effort testing representations and prompts to see where and why it fails.  Because of the \"fixed prompt\" constraint, GPT-4 either needs to make no errors, or the prompt would need error correction. And tracking a larger number of constraints in Sudoku is a harder attention control problem than previous examples I've seen. But it should be solvable, in the end. So I created this market as an experiment to see how effective prediction markets are at crowdsourcing this effort. The subsidies are to ensure that it gets attention, I plan to buy features like boosts as Manifold releases them, I plan to create derivative markets to guide people towards partial progress, and I do not plan to actively work on this problem until the market resolves so my own efforts don't interfere with the experiment. I also think, as the closing date nears, this market will get more attention from people. If this was at 10% and had large subsidies, I could easily see a student deciding to solve it over Christmas break or similar. And if you think you have a solution but don't have enough money to claim the prize by bidding, I recommend contacting   on Discord for help trading this and related markets.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I added a section with a more precise rule: \"I will test each candidate at least 5 times and if it succeeds at least once or people demand a more thorough test: the final percentage is against a fixed pool of puzzles\"(likely the January 2024 NY Times easy puzzles)\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  This has been documented in the definitions since the creation of the market.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I would accept the puzzle in that form, or in variations like \"1|1|8\".\n---\n[Date]: 04-28-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  A fixed prompt is a sequence of transition rules, and a sequence is any (computable) function from the naturals to a transition rule. So yes, the choice of how to modify the complete prompt chain can be conditioned on the turn number, which is the natural number the sequence is indexed by. Your example would seem to be the rule: which would be accepted. Here, \"insert assistant response\" and \"insert fixed message\" are two of the allowed primitives, and you can apply as many at each turn as you'd like to form a single transition rule. Your example would have the problem of filling the context size up, so you'd also need to add rules for dropping entries(maybe you'd keep a \"system\" entry to describe the algorithm, and keep the last 3 prompts).\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I got mine within 3 days of release, so it's easy for me to forget that this puzzle still isn't easily available to everyone.

A rule like \"drop the 3rd and 4th entry each time\" would work, and doesn't depend on the contents. What's forbidden is e.g. generating both branches of a backtracking search and having the operator prune the one that goes down a dead end. You can give it an exponential speedup doing that. Separately from that is your halting condition. In practice I expect most people to condition their halting on a message like ChatGPT saying \"This puzzle has now been solved\", but it's not necessary in the definition since I could always run it for the maximum turns. If It presents multiple solutions, I'd pick the last one. The main principle of a \"fixed prompt\" is that the human isn't giving ChatGPT any information beyond the puzzle setup.\n---\n[Date]: 03-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  You're allowed and expected to drop earlier turns from context according to a fixed rule each time you submit the request. You can't look at the contents of a turn to decide whether to drop it. Context management is something ChatGPT-4 is already doing, including keeping a rolling summary of the conversation.\n---\n[Date]: 03-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  GPT-4's first model has a context size of 8092 and the upcoming variant does up to 32k, so 2k sounds low to me. Since you send your last output at each step, half(4096) should be input and half should be output. But I checked Playground and see it is limited to 2048 tokens. Maybe that's just a UI limitation(writing this much output is rare). You can use up to 100 turns if using Playground with  gpt-4  . If calling the API directly allows 4k output, this isn't even a change since your solution should generalize past a few more \"continue\"s. If there's an API restriction too, I'll consider increasing the turns in the description to 100 to match the tokens I was expecting. You can also test up to 400 turns using  gpt-4  on playground, assuming  gpt-4-32k  will be released later this year and be usable for this. But it will need to be validated using fewer turns, since handling larger blocks is a harder attention problem than handling an \"equivalent\" number of smaller blocks, and it would be cheating to give it an easier problem. It's even possible the smaller context model will perform better.\n---\n[Date]: 03-29-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I'm expecting the solution to involve a \"natural language computer program\" and for the main challenge to be attention control of GPT-4 on long conversations or when matching many constraints. The \"Sparks of AGI\" paper has an example of it tracing simple Python programs, and if you could get it to trace a Sudoku solver in natural language it would qualify. The only requirement is that the same instructions have to work for many freshly-generated puzzles. I'll use the Chat Completions API to describe this more precisely. The simplest valid pattern is: With at most 100 entries(50 turns). The only \"dynamic\" input here is entry #2 which has the puzzle, and the rest is ChatGPT's responses. So this counts as a \"fixed prompt\" solution. Once image support is released, images will count as an entry(a \"half-turn\") but since GPT-4 cannot generate image outputs you'll still have to use text to track the state. The puzzle can be given as an image, and you can have other fixed images in the pattern(such as examples for reducing sections).

If they do come up snake eyes, you're devoured by snakes.\n\nSo far it sounds like you have a 1\/36 chance of dying, right?\n\nNow the twist. First, I gather up an unlimited number of people willing to play the game. I take 1 person from that pool and let them play. Then I take 2 people and have them play together, where they share a dice roll and either get the bajillion dollars each or both get devoured. Then I do the same with 4 people, and then 8, 16, and so on.\n\nAt some point one of those groups will be devoured by snakes and then I stop.\n\n[Alt. phrasing: We keep going until one of those groups is devoured by snakes, then the game stops.]\n\nIs the probability that you'll die, given that you're chosen to play, still 1\/36?\n\nArgument for NO aka the frequency argument\n\nDue to the doubling, the final group of people that die is slightly bigger than all the surviving groups put together.

More importantly, now that @dreev has passed arbitration to me, I will read the mathematical arguments of both sides and use my best professional judgement to diligently determine soundness and mathematical correctness.\n\n1. The YES bettors and the NO bettors must reach their separate consensuses as to which writeup to send me. I will only accept a single writeup per side, and will only accept these writeups in the form of a PDF or text file. If you choose to use LaTeX, send me the PDF and not the raw TeX. This must be sent to me before 2023-09-30 at 23:59 EST. I will treat any failures in this regard as a blank entry.\n\n2. The YES bettors and the NO bettors must each choose at most 3 champions per side. The role of these champions will be threefold: to contact me to send me the official writeup of their side, to answer reasonable mathematical questions about the writeups that I pose to them, and to pick formal holes in the other side's writeup to present to me. These champions must be selected and the outcome communicated to me before 2023-09-30 at 23:59 EST. I will treat any failures in this regard as a forfeit.\n\n3. All bettors of this market agree that my judgement will be final, binding, and at my sole discretion.

If only one such writeup is sound and mathematically correct, I will choose it as the winner. If only one side's champions can find flaws in the writeup of the other's, or only one side can resolve any flaws I point out in their writeup, I will choose it as the winner. If somehow neither writeup is sound and mathematically correct, and this difficulty persists equally for both sides through questioning, I will say so, and the market will resolve N\/A, making everyone including me unhappy. If both writeups are approximately sound and mathematically correct, then I will move to cross-questioning, and I will determine the winner by subjective severity of the worst irresolvable flaw any champion can pick in either writeup. If at that point I have reached the conclusion that the question was fundamentally and irresolvably ill-posed, or both sides have found comparably good flaws, I will arbitrate that the market be resolved to 30-day average of market price. [Resolve-to-MKT is fraught and we may need to hash this out better to ensure fairness -- @Lorxus mentions \"anti-spiked\" MKT price? -- but I'm nearly sure it will be moot!]\n\n5. I will communicate with all champions through the medium of their collective choice, with a Discord group chat as the default. Conditional on @dreev , at least one >2k YES holder, and at least one >2k NO holder replying to this comment to accept these terms by 2023-09-21 at 23:59 EST [which has now happened!], I will render my judgement by 2023-10-31 at 23:59 EST.

It was all massively edifying for me and I think we made a ton of progress on actual consensus. My only tiny complaint with this verdict is that it puts any weight on how well team YES and team NO performed, rather than being solely about the mathematical truth of the matter. But that's a tiny complaint indeed because if both teams had been perfect mathematicians, we'd still be (to use Lorxus's estimate) 98% YES.

[edit: sorry, reading comprehension fail; you said it was too noisy in the Discord, which is fair] Here's my characterization of where we ended up, framed in terms of what would be needed for a NO victory: It's a tight needle to thread and, if I've characterized things correctly, it's why   considered resolving to 98% YES instead of full YES. It's not  impossible  to argue for NO but there are multiple solid YES arguments. I think the tie-breaker was how thoroughly   attacked every mathematical challenge Lorxus and team NO threw at us. Team NO also did brilliant work (I learned a lot from them along the way) and were crucial in reaching the consensus that we can't fully fairly take limits of truncated games.  But they haven't engaged with the nonuniform prior argument yet. It would be great if any other NO believers are game to do that. And it's so wild! I would never have believed it. I encourage people to step through the proof in section 4 of  our write-up  or try  Bartha & Hitchcock's version  (section 2). I think it leads inexorably to 1\/36 and I really, really want to understand where the flaw is if there is one.

I've now spent 179 hours and counting on this problem and this market and its derivatives and am feeling very confident that YES is the mathematically correct answer. Resolution is out of my hands, of course, but still. Btw, I just added another  long comment  summarizing the state of things in the Variant N market (now alternatively called the \"Euclid's mom\" variant, for reasons that are explained over there). In short, I now believe that  even for Variant N  the answer is 1\/36, unless we go down a hyperreal -- to use the math term -- rabbit hole. Finally, I'm confident in this answer even without all the clarifications I tried to add, from back when taking a limit of a truncated game was the only approach I'd conceived of. Team NO was reasonable to reject those attempted clarifications, but ultimately it doesn't help their case. I'm about to remove those clarifications now, which should make the problem statement a lot cleaner.\n---\n[Date]: 10-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Agreed that this is about how an agent should behave\/bet. But this is interesting because I'm a Sleeping Beauty thirder but  not  a Snake Eyes halfer. The latest idea from the Discord, from   (who, interestingly, is a Sleeping Beauty halfer), is a simulation in which we can safely ignore the chance of exhausting the pool of people.  The trick is to bump the chance of \"snake eyes\" way up -- we settled on p=75% -- so that we can have a tractable pool size (~1 million) that in practice is never exhausted. (Previous simulations have been controversial because we haven't agreed on what should happen in the case of running out of people to play.)  Team NO's math predicts that for p=75%, the protagonist (we now call him Euclid) will die 91% of the time that he's chosen to play. Team YES's math says 75%. I'm not sure about that 91% but I have enough faith in our math that I'm pretty much willing to commit to admitting that a result of anything other than 75% means YES is wrong.

The problem says people are chosen uniformly from the pool. So from the perspective of a completed game, there's no possible evidence either way for you being in the lucky vs unlucky half of the chosen players. Team YES has to make one of two counterarguments: What I absolutely love about this is that, if you'd given the above arguments to me at the outset, I'd have reacted like so: So, yeah, I'm extremely sympathetic to team NO here, but now believe  the math  does not turn out in their favor, very much contra my own initial expectations.\n---\n[Date]: 10-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Definitely. I mean, we're debating a probability, so turning it into a bet is straightforward: You join a pool of players for the protocol in the description here. But instead death or a bajillion dollars, I just charge you $1000 if you roll snake eyes and pay you $500 if you roll anything else. If you're not chosen to play (never roll the dice) then no money changes hands. Team YES would pay up to $450 to play that game. Team NO would have to  get  paid $250 to play it.\n---\n[Date]: 10-25-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Yeah, I'm with Roma, despite also believing you're 100% right! Which is to say, this needs way more explanation than just \"depends if the game ended\". For starters, with probability 1 the game will end in a finite number of rounds, right? So something bizarre has to happen for your probability to change just by conditioning on something you're already certain of. Another way to put it: Take the perspective of a candidate player (we've started calling him \"Euclid\" instead of \"you\"). Where  exactly  does the reasoning of \"eventually the game will end and he'll be in a set of people half of whom are dead\" go wrong? Or if you're on team NO, where  exactly  does the reasoning of \"if he's chosen to play he'll get one fair dice roll, independent of any other rolls\" go wrong? That's what a resolution of this paradox has to do, I feel.\n---\n[Date]: 10-25-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Intense debate and incredibly fruitful discussion is ongoing in Lorxus's Discord (feel free to join us:  https:\/\/discord.gg\/ujWdfCj4  -- I think those invite links last a week). The rate at which I'm learning new math just to keep up is  still  sky high. Today I learned about the  Ross-Littlewood paradox . But then we decided, I think, that we're on safe ground there, thanks to  Bartha & Hitchcock 's system of draft numbers. By draft number we mean position in the queue from which people are chosen to play Snake Eyes. So you have a draft number in \u2115 and a prior over \u2115 on what that draft number is. For example, you have some tiny chance you're chosen first, and the chance you're among the first N people chosen, for any finite N, gradually approaches 1 as N goes to infinity. There's no N beyond which you consider it impossible for you to be chosen. No truncation of the game necessary! Also we've taken to saying \"Euclid\" instead of \"you\" because \"you, the player being chosen to play in the game\" vs \"you, generic reader\" was potentially confusing. Bartha & Hitchcock solve the same problem by naming the player George. They also talk about George's mother, Tracy, who learns after the fact that George has been chosen to play this game. The George-vs-Tracy framing -- or let's stick with Euclid and Euclid's mom here -- helps highlight the paradox. If Euclid and his mom have the same information, they must assign the same probability to Euclid's death. But for Euclid the Argument for YES (aka one fair dice roll) seems particularly unassailable and for Euclid's mom the Argument for NO (aka the frequency argument: Euclid is one of N people who played, half are dead) seems similarly watertight. To summarize my latest understanding of the conclusions: Let's set aside #3 as well. I'm not sure if we'll be resorting to that or if we'll all end up on the same page about #2. So what's actually wrong with the frequency argument if Euclid and his mom have a common prior over his possible draft numbers? Very roughly, it's that Euclid is very unlikely to be chosen early on and his probability of getting chosen later has to keep decreasing. When you learn that he was chosen, you infer that a huge number of rounds must've been played and that, due to that decreasing prior, Euclid was probably chosen before the final deadly round. So half the people died but Euclid was more likely in the surviving half. Which makes it sound like this decreasing prior is violating the spirit of the setup somehow? But the amazing thing is that  any  prior will do, no matter how close to uniform it is. In the limit as the prior approaches uniform, it's still 1\/36 that Euclid died. Or here's a slightly less rough argument: Forget about when snake eyes is rolled and just ask: given that Euclid is chosen  by  some finite round N, what are the chances he's selected  on  round N? Well, round N has more people than all previous rounds combined, so probably he's chosen on round N. That means snake eyes before round N is correspondingly unlikely: Euclid won't be chosen if the game ends before round N and Euclid is in round N. Which, as we just concluded, he probably is. Ok, so Euclid being chosen by round N means snake eyes probably happens on or after round N. Which means probably after, since round N in particular is unlikely. The punchline is that that's all true for literally any finite N, no matter how huge! If Euclid was chosen by the googolplex'th round, probably he was chosen  on  the googolplex'th round. And for that to happen, we needed to go a googolplex (minus one) rounds with no snake eyes. And if we did that then we expect about a googolplex + 36 rounds before we finally hit snake eyes. (I mean, in reality we'd long since have been convinced the dice were rigged, but this is mathworld so \"googolplex + 36 more rolls\" it is!) In other words, Euclid being chosen by some round N means snake eyes probably happens after that, for literally all N. Now we just have to do a  bunch of math  and maybe  even more math  to work out what that \"probably\" is exactly. Spoiler: it's 17\/18 or 1-2p in the limit that snake eyes happens after round N given that Euclid is chosen by round N. Which means Euclid's chance of death is the 1\/18 or 2p chance that snake eyes does happen by round N times a 50% chance (the old frequency argument) that he's in the unlucky half. So 2p\/2 = p. Or 1\/36.\n---\n[Date]: 10-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That sounds like a different genre: trick questions!

Maybe my proof is correct for a slightly different question? Namely, what is the expectation of the  dead\/chosen  ratio in the limit?\n---\n[Date]: 10-18-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I think I have a proof for that last assertion -- the probability of death given chosen in  's infinitely repeated version of the game: We can compute the expectation of the initial  dead\/played  ratio after round 1 like so: p * 1\/1 + (1-p) * 0\/1 = p That's just saying that we get 1\/1 dead if the first person rolls snake eyes, otherwise 0\/1 dead.. Now suppose that we're about to roll for round  n  and so far we have  D  dead out of  2^(n-1)-1  who've played. (After any round  i  there are always  2^i-1  who've played cumulatively,  2^(i-1)  of whom played in round  i  itself.) That means the previous  dead\/played  ratio is  D \/ (2^(n-1) - 1) . Call that  r  for short. So with probability  p  the new ratio will be  (D + 2^(n-1)) \/ (2^n - 1)  and with probability  1-p   the new ratio will be  D \/ (2^n - 1) . That means the new expected ratio is  p  times the first thing plus  1-p  times the second thing, which, after a somewhat painful amount of algebra can be turned into this: 2^(n-1) \/ (2^n - 1) * (r + p) - r \/ (2^n - 1) And, lo, if we take the limit of that as  n  goes to infinity we get  (r+p)\/2  which is just the average of  r , the previous ratio, and  p . So the  dead\/played  ratio converges to  p  in the limit.\n---\n[Date]: 10-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Still preliminary but here's how our answers to these questions are shaping up: Finally, the question for both sides: What changes in an infinitely repeating version where, after a group dies from rolling snake eyes, we still double the group size and just keep going forever? I think this turns out to be a beautiful intuition pump for YES. We now have an infinite number of people, all of whom get to roll the dice. From NO's perspective we should be able to just partition that infinite game into chunks that end in snake eyes and apply their reasoning to each chunk. About half the people in each chunk will die and therefore the probability of dying in the infinite game is also about a half. But that can't be right. We've removed all the randomness for choosing who plays, because everyone plays. The only remaining randomness is what dice roll you get on the one round where you play. So you die with probability 1\/36. Everything is consistent in YES world and we have a contradiction in NO world. We could even simulate that. Keep a running tally of  dead  and  played  -- initially both zero -- and initialize a counter, n, to 1. Now do this: And just keep doing it and watch the  dead\/played  ratio. Is it converging to 1\/36 or to 1\/2? (It's 1\/36, right? I hope? I haven't tried yet...)\n---\n[Date]: 10-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: PS: To drive home the point about \"any prior\", that includes priors that put positive probability on all infinitely many future rounds in which you could be picked.

That's the fraction of people dead, from the perspective of a completed game. The difference between that and the prospective probability is the key subtlety. Pr(death) = 0 because you won't be chosen. Pr(death | chosen) = 1\/36. Add conditionals to those and it does seem to be an elegant derivation of why, if you already knew that Pr(death | chosen) = 1\/36, that Pr(infinite | chosen) must be 17\/18. Thank you for that! We derive that without presuming that Pr(death | chosen) = 1\/36 in section 3 of  our writeup  (the section that was called \"Discussion\" in the original submission, not the section we added on non-uniform priors). Right, it's zero, or infinitesimal. Or it was. But then we got some Bayesian evidence. Namely, you were chosen to play out of an infinite pool. In a sense that can  only happen  in the \"impossible\" universe in which we roll not-snake-eyes forever. Ah, perfect, this is absolutely the right framework to resolve this kind of disagreement. We just have to factor in the conditional probability. You and I have no disagreement on how long it will take to roll snake eyes unconditionally (a few dozen rolls, negligible chance of it taking 1000 rolls). So I wouldn't be pumped by that particular money-pump. But there should be one I  am  pumped by if I'm wrong. Like my eagerness to play the game at all should be exploitable if I should rationally expect a ~1\/2 chance of dying.\n---\n[Date]: 10-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  But, at risk of undermining the team YES position, Martin Randall showed a specific way to do it: I.e., give the horizontal line some triangular thickness and take the limit as the length of the right side of that triangle goes to zero.

(Bartha & Hitchcock joke in a footnote that their paper has an underlying political objective: \"to 'empower' measurably challenged sets by letting them claim their rightful place in the world of conditionalization.\") Anyway, Bartha & Hitchcock give the example of a square dartboard with a horizontal line halfway down. A dart is equally likely to land anywhere on the square. Now we ask: conditional on the dart landing  on that horizontal line , what are the chances it lands on the left half of the line? Our intuition screams 1\/2 but if we try to prove that, since the probability of hitting the horizontal line is exactly 0, the answer seems to be 0\/0. Which is kind of like saying \"well the dart won't land exactly on the line so the question is moot or meaningless\". What to do? Well, a very natural thing to have meant by the question in the first place is: Give the line a tiny thickness and take the limit as the thickness goes to zero. So reasonable! But now consider a circular dartboard, and instead of a horizontal line, we're asking about a radial line. Same story, we throw a dart that can land anywhere in the circle. Now, conditional on landing  on that red\/blue radial line , what's the probability it lands on the red half? Now there are two reasonable answers, depending on the limiting process we pick. If we just give the line a uniform thickness like before (see the circle on the left in the above figure) then the answer is 1\/2. If we say that the line is actually an infinitely thin pie slice (see the circle on the right) then the answer is 1\/4. Sure, there's no obvious rationale for a pie-slice limiting process in the square-with-horizontal-line scenario \u2014 but you could do it if you really wanted. It would converge to the horizontal line in the limit. And, disturbingly, it would tell you that the probability of landing on one half of the line was less than the probability of landing on the other half. Personally, this doesn't feel too devastating. Just use a limiting process that makes sense for the problem at hand? But this does seem to be a potential can of worms, I guess? See also the  Bertrand paradox  (there's a particularly elucidating  exposition of it  and  musing about it  in a pair of Numberphile videos featuring Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown).

If you insist on both (a) no finite version of the game to take a limit of and (b) a fully uniform prior, then we have to use nonstandard analysis. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd13\u03b5\u2797*\u211d\ud83d\ude40 There's an infinitesimal chance you're chosen to play in any finite number of rounds. I think (correct me if i'm misrepresenting) team NO is saying we can avoid this by having neither an infinite pool nor a finite cutoff. Imagine creating people as necessary for each group. No such thing as running out of people, no truncation of the game. Then the question becomes: Given you exist, what's your probability of death? I maintain this is a very different question. In fact, I think it's side-stepping the paradox to just consider the ultimately-conjured people in Snake Eyes. We all agree that the fraction of such people who die after snake eyes is eventually rolled is ~1\/2. That's just the \"Argument for NO\" in the original problem statement. The point of the paradox is to reconcile that with the \"Argument for YES\". In other words, there's a frequency argument and a one-fair-roll argument. Unless we find a flaw in one of those arguments, we haven't resolved the paradox. Team NO says the one-fair-roll argument is answering a different question and we should focus on what fraction of people end up dead when the game is over. No no no.  The whole point is that they are the same question!  Does the one-fair-roll argument mean you  should  play or does the frequency argument mean you  shouldn't ? (What's this \"should play\"? Who would ever want even a 1\/36 chance of getting devoured by snakes? I don't think this ends up mattering but that's why the problem says you get a bajillion dollars if you don't roll snake eyes: So that we can assume you do want to play the one-shot version and then ask if the doubling-groups scheme changes your mind. It's meant as a decision-theory problem: to play or not to play? I'm fairly sure we've all been on the same page about this all along. Team NO is very much claiming that the doubling groups means you're ~probably gonna die if you roll the dice in the infinite version of this game. And from the perspective of a completed game, it's true that most such people are dead! So it's pretty dang compelling.) Anyway, another way to side-step the paradox is to say 0\/0 is undefined, end of story. You won't be chosen from an infinite pool so who cares? Well,  we  care! That's the question before us.  IF  (call it a crazy thought-experiment hypothetical) we're somehow chosen out of that infinite pool, then how worried are we? Less worried because it's still one fair dice roll? Or more worried because we'll be part of a population ~1\/2 of whom are dead? It's a beautiful and deep question. I had to learn a lot of math before I was sure of the answer. And to review team YES's  resolution of the paradox , we're saying the frequency argument really is wrong. It neglects the infinitesimal chance of rolling not-snake-eyes forever and everyone surviving. You'd sure think that'd be neglectable but, amazingly, it turns out not to be. Conditioning on the impossible is weird that way. But the conclusion is you should play.\n---\n[Date]: 10-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: We're working on more specific responses but we've also tried to route around a lot of those by adding a new section to  our YES writeup . It's now organized into 4 sections: I believe we've met team NO's challenge in section 4 (and am betting heavily on it!), deriving the answer without assuming that you can define a finite version of the game and taking a limit of it. In our original writeup we said you have probability zero of being chosen out of an infinite pool and so trying to Bayes it out directly gives 0\/0 and so we'll make it a finite pool and take the limit. But, says team NO, things are very different in any finite version. Namely, it's possible for no one to die! In the infinite version a group is definitely eventually dying. We (team YES) made this whole argument about how it all makes sense, that we're saying that conditional on this impossible thing (being chosen out of infinite people) this other impossible thing (rolling not-snake-eyes forever) is actually quite likely. But ok, say we reject that. There's a different way we can avoid the division by zero: a nonuniform prior. You don't have zero probability of being chosen out of the infinite pool, you have some arbitrarily small but positive probability. Maybe you have 1\/N probability of being in any of the first N groups and zero after that. We can make N arbitrarily big. I.e., we can take the limit as your prior approaches uniform. Amazingly, any prior will do. Math it out for a totally general prior and the answer is (drum roll) 1\/36.\n---\n[Date]: 10-14-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]: For those following along at home,   has given team YES and team NO a list of cross examination questions. Here's a condensed version of them: Questions for YES: 1. Can we better\u00a0justify treating the answer to the infinite\/unlimited game as the limit of a finite version? 2. Are we assuming that zero times infinity is zero somehow? 3. Are we St Petersburg paradoxing ourselves? 4. How can we justify the finite version of the game we've chosen where no one dies if we run out of people? Is that too arbitrary? 5. Can we get more precise about what \"chosen\" means? 6. Can we say more about that 17\/18 for Pr(rolling not-snake-eyes forever | chosen)? 7. If the pool is infinite then why isn't the answer immediately zero? You just won't be chosen, end of story. 8. And do we even need a pool? Can we have you only exist at all if you're chosen to play the game? 9. How are we handling infinities? Questions for NO: 1. Why isn't the probability in the unbounded case in between the limit of the bounded-death case and limit of the bounded-escape case? 2. Can we find a closed form for the 52.2%? 3. Where does rejecting the finite version leave us? Does it mean that Pr(death | chosen) is neither 1\/36 nor 52%? 4. Something about uniform distributions over the integers? 5. Why is Team YES wrong about Pr(chosen) and Pr(ever rolling snake eyes) not being conditionally independent? 6. Does Team NO assume the starting population is however many people ended up playing? 7. What's actually wrong with the core YES argument that if you're chosen you just get one fair dice roll? Question for both: What changes in an infinitely repeating version where, after a group dies from rolling snake eyes we still double the group size and just keep going forever? If you're one of those countably infinite people, you'll definitely eventually be chosen. What's your probability of death?\n---\n[Date]: 10-03-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I'm not sure if this is going to be a dumb caricature of  's argument or if it will help but... Say we want to find the length of the diagonal of a unit square by taking a limit. One (silly) way to do that is to find the diagonal of an infinitesimal square which is \u221a2\u22c5\u03b5 and multiply that by the number of infinitesimal squares, 1\/\u03b5, et voila, \u221a2. An even worse way is to make a staircase, which,  as we've seen , yields the same diagonal in the limit but with a length of 2 instead of \u221a2.  So we have two limits that are seemingly the same at infinity but disagree with each other. I'm pretty comfortable with \"the staircase one is wrong, paradox resolved\" but probably real mathematicians have a better answer? I'm hopeful that whatever that answer is, it works for Snake Eyes as well!\n---\n[Date]: 10-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Just a note that in addition the submitted version, we have the  latest version of our YES writeup  that we've continued to polish.

But \"let's take the limit as the size goes to infinity\" is just... the most standard approach to such math problems. So I guess I'm disagreeing that Option LIM amounts to dropping the assumption of unlimited players. It's just making \"unlimited\" more rigorous by turning it into this: \"we'll say there  is  a limit but then take the limit as that limit goes to infinity so that in the limit it's  un limited\". Oops, I just semantically satiated on \"limit\". Let's try that again with \"cap\": What we'll mean by  unlimited  is that we start with a finite cap but then we take the limit as that cap goes to infinity so that in the limit there's an infinite cap aka it's unlimited.\n---\n[Date]: 10-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good comment!

Saying that it doesn't work to have a  literally infinite  pool but that we can have an  arbitrarily large  pool and see what happens in the limit feels like the most natural thing in the world to me. (It actually wouldn't have occurred to me to handle it any other way, which is presumably what's caused all the controversy and consternation in this market!) Re: nonuniform priors: I guess I'm coming around to the argument that a perfectly uniform prior isn't essential. But that's easy for me to say, because I think the math is rock solid in that case: Pr(death | chosen) = 1\/36 regardless of whether we assume the game ends in a finite number of rounds. As for using standard probability measures, deviating from that initially felt kind of outrageous to me. Like the problem would've absolutely had to have said so if we wanted to allow for craziness like that. But I guess I'm coming around on this as well!\n---\n[Date]: 10-02-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]: I know some of you are way ahead of me but the  Bartha & Hitchcock paper  is kind of amazing. Everything is exactly the same as the setup here except they use 10x'ing groups instead of doubling groups, which turns out to have no impact on any of the proofs.  So my latest understanding is that we've got three particular assumptions we thought we could make but they're not mutually compatible. We have to pick two of them: Option LIM: We take the limit of a truncated game (drop 1, keep 2 & 3) This is what the  YES writeup  focuses on. (And I think it's what the problem statement says to do, but I'm biased I suppose.) Option NUP: No uniform prior (drop 2, keep 1 & 3) Suppose, as I believe team NO prefers, we want to only consider the infinite game. Also suppose we want standard probability measures. Then we have to abandon the uniform prior. That contradicts the problem statement but NO is happy to reject parts of the problem statement that don't jibe (or that I added unfairly?) so let's see what happens if we do this. Here's what happens. First we introduce what Bartha and Hitchcock call draft numbers to represent your prior probability distribution over when you'll be picked. If your draft number is 1 then you're picked first. If your draft number is 2 or 3 then you're picked for the second, two-person group. Etc. As yet another surprise in this cornucopian paradox, it doesn't matter what prior you use for your draft number (as long the probabilities sum to 1): the answer will be the same. Of course, summing to one over all natural numbers means you must, in some way, expect to be chosen sooner rather than later. Maybe you think you're equally likely to be any of the first trillion drafts and then it gets gradually less likely thereafter. Any consistent prior will do. We can Bayes it out for an arbitrary such prior and the answer is 1\/36. That's true whether or not we condition on the game ending in a finite number of rolls. I replicated Bartha & Hitchcock's math  with pen and paper  and am satisfied. Option HYP: Use hyperreals and nonstandard analysis (drop 3, keep 1 & 2) I suppose there's a persnickety sense in which this is the option we're forced into for Snake Eyes, since it's the only thing the problem statement never says explicitly: that we're using standard analysis. (Of course I meant us to be, since I didn't even know what nonstandard analysis was until last week, but we're in death-of-the-author mode here -- HT  .) I'm not caught up with the math but I now believe Bartha & Hitchcock: the answer depends on whose perspective we're using. Say you're volunteering to be in the pool and don't know if the game will end. Sure, with probability 1 it will, but there's an infinitesimal chance that snake eyes will never be rolled. In that case Pr(death | chosen) is 1\/36. But if it's your friend who played and you do know the game ended, then it's probability ~1\/2 that they died. Probably we agree that for Snake Eyes we're asking from the player's  pro spective perspective? So not conditioning on the game ending in a finite number of rounds. Again, we're certain it will but in Option HYP there's an infinitesimal chance it doesn't and we are not ruling that infinitesimal chance out when asking for Pr(death | chosen). -- So as best I can tell, all three roads lead to YES here. I'm betting heavily on it! (And very grateful to   that it's fair for me to do so.) Exciting stuff!\n---\n[Date]: 09-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Woo-hoo!

Favorite excerpt as I'm (re-)reading it: My view of how this plays out in the Snake Eyes paradox is as follows. You're in an arbitrarily large group of people and you're virtually certain you won't be chosen to play. We expect to take a few dozen rolls to hit snake eyes and the game to end. That's an infinitesimal fraction of the pool ending up playing. So mostly I'm utterly indifferent to participating. But the question is, in the vanishingly unlikely event that I am chosen to play, what are my odds? Conditioning on that changes everything. I'm no longer dealing with zero-probability scenarios. Given that I'm chosen to play, the previously vanishing probability that we roll non-snake-eyes a gazillion times in a row becomes [math math math] 17\/18 in the limit.  So probably I will be ok!  More math says that, lo and behold, I have the same 1\/36 chance of dying as in the one-shot version. Which is good because how else were we going to counter the original YES argument -- that if I'm chosen to play, I get one fair and independent dice roll. What about the seemingly airtight NO argument, that just over half the players chosen always die? The answer is that they don't  always  die. This is where the infinite value concentrated on a zero-probability outcome comes in. There's a zero probability of never rolling snake eyes ever forever and an infinite number of people all surviving. (But the previous sentence isn't mathematically rigorous so we instead say that there's a tiny probability of a huge number of people all surviving and then we take the limit as that \"huge\" goes to infinity.) Eager to hear if any of that persuades you! PS: And then the way to salvage the NO argument, according to my best current understanding, is to argue that the problem statement implies that we condition not only on being chosen to play but on snake eyes being rolled before we run out of people. Just saying \"we won't run out of people so that doesn't matter\" doesn't cut it, mathematically, I'm pretty sure. Or maybe  's anthropics argument also gets us there? I'm still working on that!\n---\n[Date]: 09-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Woo-hoo!

Presumably they can be found via the API, and I just figured out I can see them on mobile. But on desktop the first day-ish of trading after market creation is missing for me. When I said that the clarified market description (where no one dies if we run out of people before rolling snake eyes) was there from the beginning, in the sense that no one had traded before that clarification was added -- um, not quite true! I'm not sure how much it matters; none of the big NO holders had traded yet. But I wanted to set the record straight on that. If the NO bettors wanted to argue that the entire list of clarifications should be disregarded on that basis, that's... slightly less crazy than I previously thought? My counterargument is that without any clarifications the question was woefully underspecified. As we're discussing in  Snake Eyes Variant N , it's begging for clarification on what \"eventually we'll roll snake eyes\" means. Is it just a thing that happens with probability 1 in the limit? Or is it an additional thing to condition on, along with being chosen to play? The clarification was (based on the timestamps) there within 24 hours of market creation but not quite \"from the beginning\" as I previously claimed!

My understanding of the strongest case for NO is to interpret \"at some point we roll snake eyes\" to mean that in addition to conditioning on being chosen to play, we are also conditioning on snake eyes being rolled before running out of people in the finite version of the game. The clarifications explicitly rule out that interpretation so the NO argument has to also make the case for why we need to disregard those clarifications. (If it's just that the clarifications are worded poorly or tacked on confusingly then I think that's more an argument that resolving YES is unfair to NO bettors -- that they were misled by the question -- and we'd need to resolve N\/A. I'm amenable to that argument but: ) In any case, I think you're right that at best the NO side can argue that the question is too self-contradictory to have a real-number answer. See  Snake Eyes Variant N  for an attempted steelmanning of the NO side. Even there I'm not yet convinced that NO wins but interesting discussion is ongoing.

I'm fine with letting the NO bettors pick the version, as   proposes. Or, well, let's let them propose something specific if they don't think the current description truncated after FAQ5 is fairest. It looks like the explicit stipulation that it's possible in the finite version for no one to die was there within 24 hours or so of market creation and FAQs 1-5 were in their current form some hours later. I don't think we need to close trading, even during adjudication, though Martin's warning is well taken. Don't get caught up in the excitement and bet more than you can afford to lose! Oh, but if resolve-to-MKT is on the table then maybe that's prudent? But I'd rather see Lorxus make their own assessment of the mathematical Truth. If that's in between NO and YES, fine, but don't give us any control over that. As for recruiting more mathematicians, I think it's too late. I committed to going with Lorxus before I had any clues about which way Lorxus might be leaning. Now I have some clues and so anything else I do has a conflict of interest. If Lorxus wants to add mathematicians to the committee, they're free to. As for Kongo being blocked, it seems that was for unrelated reasons and Lorxus is happy to unblock them, so no issue there.

Consider your second question where we wait till the game is concluded, and allow for the zero-probability-but-it-turns-out-to-matter case that an infinite number of people all play and none die because we roll non-snake-eyes forever. Now when we randomly choose someone who played, there's a huge bias towards the case where an infinite number of people played and 100% of them survived. That's roughly why the answer is not ~1\/2 even for your second question. Of course we can't deal with infinity directly but the logic is the same if we imagine an astronomical number of people. There's a tiny chance that we roll non-snake-eyes long enough to run out of people. If you pick a random person from that huge pool and condition on them being chosen, then the most likely way for that to happen is that we got so lucky that we never rolled snake eyes. Without conditioning on that person being chosen, we probably rolled snake eyes in the first few dozen rolls. But, still roughly speaking, we eliminate those outcomes because our randomly chosen person never got a chance to play in those outcomes. Weirdly, in the limit as the pool size goes to infinity, the probability of everyone surviving given that an arbitrary, pre-identified person (aka \"you\") was chosen converges to exactly 17\/18. So that's 17\/18=34\/36 probability you play and survive because everyone survives. In the remaining 1\/18 probability where you play and snake eyes is rolled, you have, in the limit, a 1\/2 probability of surviving. So altogether your probability of surviving given that you play is  17\/18*1 + 1\/18*1\/2 = 34\/36 + 1\/36 = 35\/36 . See Wamba's writeup for deriving that 17\/18. I think highlighting the conditional probability that  everyone survives  even though unconditionally that won't happen really throws it into sharp relief. My latest thinking is that even in  Snake Eyes Variant N  there's an at least semi-reasonable interpretation where the probability of death given that you play is still 1\/36. Eager to hear if the above is persuasive, that the two questions really do turn out to be the same.\n---\n[Date]: 09-14-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: In fairness to the NO side, we should arguably not treat FAQs 6-9 as part of the problem statement. As I say in the description, I added those in an attempt to clarify and I personally think they do that but from the NO perspective those are changing the interpretation of the problem after people had started trading. (As I've said a couple times recently in other markets, in general I think that if you're trading on a technicality, that's totally fine but it needs the clarifying question. E.g., \"In the finite version we use for taking the limit, what exactly happens if we run out of people?\" See my  latest comment about multiple reasonable interpretations even in Variant N . So I don't share the opinion of the NO bettors that I was being unfair in adding clarifications 6-9 based on questions that arose but I'm willing to err in their favor on that.

Diving in: Who was that? I'd like to reread their arguments. The market description clarifies which clarifications were added when. The seeming self-contradiction I believe you're objecting to was there from the start. What's the problem here? That that doesn't work with an infinite set? That's one reason we take a limit. The only portion I know of that could imply NO is \"at some point one of those groups will be devoured by snakes\" and I'm indeed worried about that. If you take it to mean \"in addition to conditioning on being chosen, also condition on snake eyes getting rolled before running out of people\" then NO would be correct, as you say. There are multiple reasons I don't personally think that's a reasonable interpretation. The clarifications that were there from before anyone started trading explicitly rule it out and I think it's not the most natural interpretation anyway. It actually brings us to the heart of the paradox. To quote myself from the  Variant N discussion , here's a thing that happens with exactly 0% probability but the possibility of it happening anyway totally changes this posterior probability! I don't understand this part. I don't see the problem with the limiting process. You select groups until you roll snake eyes or run out of people, which, in the limit happens with probability 0. Where's the invalidity? I don't agree here but to be clear, if you're right then it would not be fair to resolve to YES based on FAQ8 since that was added later. My claim is that FAQ8 was already implicit in the original clarifications. I'm struggling to understand your version so far. Does it end up equivalent to  Snake Eyes Variant N ? If not, can you contrast it? What I so far think is the crux is whether \"at some point we'll roll snake eyes\" naturally means \"condition on rolling snake eyes\". Another reason I don't think that's a reasonable interpretation is because the problem is explicit about conditioning on being chosen. To condition on an additional thing the problem would need to say so. \"Conditional on being chosen  and on rolling snake eyes before running out of people \". That's legit confusing because it's a thing that happens with probability 1 in the limit so conditioning on it or not would normally not matter. But, again, that's the paradox. In this case it does matter.\n---\n[Date]: 09-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I just created the two variants suggested by  : If, hypothetically so far, the answer for Variant Y (what I meant this market to be) is clearly 1\/36 and for Variant N is clearly ~1\/2, and if NO bettors aver that Variant N is how they interpreted this market, then that could be an argument that the fairest thing to do for this market is resolve to N\/A. In any case, I worry that throwing this to the mathematicians for resolution without having clarity on the above could be unfair.\n---\n[Date]: 09-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good point. And, yeah, it was definitely part of an argument for Yes just like the ball&urn one is an argument for No.\n---\n[Date]: 09-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The NO bettors are a confusing mix of not understanding conditional probability, having legitimate concerns about ambiguity in the problem statement, trollish language-lawyers, and those having potentially deep insights on the philosophy of probability, including anthropics. I really want to disentangle those before resolving. Which is good for the NO bettors because, based on the mathematicians replying in the comments (at least one is a YES bettor) and those I've talked to IRL, there's not really any way for this to resolve NO. Conceivably it could resolve N\/A if the problem statement is just too self-contradictory for YES to be fair. (Again, I don't personally think that's true but I'm doing my best to keep my personal opinion from affecting the resolution of this market.) I now think  's proposed variants are the best way to determine that. Counterexamples: the two-round Snake Eyes resolved cleanly to 1\/36 and the ball&urn version resolved cleanly to ~1\/2. Snibgiblets did replicate the controversy, but for a much simpler question, so I think that was helpful in isolating the controversy here.\n---\n[Date]: 09-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I'm working on homing in on the cruxes via these variants. I'm deeply interested in the underlying mathematical truth of the matter, from at least a couple angles. One is decision theory: can we construct a version of this game that's genuinely a good idea to play the one-shot version of and a bad idea to play the doubling-groups version of? Another is philosophy of probability, like in the Sleeping Beauty paradox. I feel like I'm making steady progress. I apologize for taking forever. If I had thought to make the market deadline-less from the start, as it is now, how much would that have ameliorated your frustration? I was trying to convince   to create markets for Snake Eyes Variant Y and Snake Eyes Variant N, as discussed in the comments here. I'm willing to do so if no one else wants to. I think it will be elucidating. If it turns out that everyone agrees about those variants then we'll have reached consensus about the underlying truth of the matter and then it'd just be a matter of adjudicating how badly I screwed up this market description, creating ambiguity between those variants. (I don't think that's the right characterization but I think those variants will help us find out!)\n---\n[Date]: 09-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Confirmed that the probability goes up in your example of randomly finding a dollar. This is how Bayesian updating and conditional probability works. Here's a fun related puzzle I was about to type here but lemme make a market for it instead:  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/dreev\/goldenbrown-pancakes-whats-the-prob\n---\n[Date]: 09-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The ball&urn version is resolved! Itsy-bitsy-confetti-emoji! It's at least a small update towards NO in this market but here's the short version for why I think the ball&urn version of Snake Eyes is different (see  my comment there  for details): This version asks for your own probability, as a candidate player in the pool, that you'll roll snake eyes. That's always 1\/36 and nothing about the way we choose groups and combine rolls can change that -- you still get your one roll if you're chosen to play at all, and there's only one way to die, which is to hit snake eyes on that roll. Predicting NO in this market begs for an explanation of how exactly that can be wrong. But in the ball&urn version we're not pre-identifying a ball like that. We're pretty much just asking what fraction of people end up dead after the process ends. Most of the time that fraction is roughly 1\/2. It can be more than 1\/2 if you roll snake eyes early, or less than 1\/2 if you never roll snake eyes. When you never roll snake eyes you get a huge (in the limit: infinite) number of people all surviving but that doesn't matter in the ball&urn version. A fraction with a massive numerator and equally massive denominator is just 1. In the original Snake Eyes, that case gets a huge weighting because it contains most of the probability space from the perspective of a pre-identified person. In the ball&urn version it gets a vanishing fraction of the probability space. Here's a more stylized version that may help with the intuition: Start with a million balls. With 99% probability we eliminate all but one ball and deflate it. With 1% probability we eliminate no balls and leave them all inflated. Two questions: The answer to question 1 is that 99% of the time we get a deflated ball and 1% of the time we get an inflated ball. So 99% chance of deflated. The answer to question 2 is that your pre-selected ball probably gets eliminated. If it's not eliminated then almost certainly we're in the 1% world where it stays inflated. So 99% chance eliminated, near 100% chance inflated if not eliminated. I claim that the ball&urn version of Snake Eyes is similar to question 1 and this version of Snake Eyes is similar to question 2.  -- PS: I did not at all expect that when I posed the ball&urn version. I imagined it as a way to factor out the anthropics question and yield a nice unambiguous argument for 1\/36. I'm now wondering if anthropic reasoning is a way to get to 1\/36 in this version, if we use the isomorphism where being chosen to play is being conjured into existence. Of course that's what Martin Randall did in his writeup and got the opposite conclusion so I'm now trying to get my head around that.\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Perfect, yes, so that's the beauty of this paradox. Snake eyes is eventually going to get rolled, with probability 1. And conditioning a probability on something with probability 1 doesn't change the probability. Except in this case it does! I think the most striking way to see this, that I only figured out the other day, though of course   worked it out a long time ago, is these two facts: I think the NO bettors, if they accept the above will say something like, \"Nonetheless, the problem states that snake eyes will in fact be rolled eventually, which implies conditioning on that happening. Later contradicting that in the fine print is unfair.\" (And then my counterargument is that the problem was explicit about conditioning on being chosen to play. If it was meant to also be conditioned on the game ending in snake eyes it would've had to have said so. That's not implicit in the fact that ending in snake eyes has probability 1. Normally, an event having probability 1 makes it perfectly safe to condition on, but, surprisingly, not here.)\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yeah, resolving N\/A is a last resort. I'm just worried that YES is what's most mathematically correct but that the NO bettors will feel grievously wronged by that. I mean, going by mathematician-consensus lets me wash my hands of that but I want to fully understand the NO perspective. So is your \"revert time\" version the same as this: You're 1 of N people in a pool, with the groups and dice rolls as before. Conditional on being chosen for one of the groups  and on snake eyes being rolled before running out of people , what is your probability of death? What is the limit of that conditional probability as N goes to infinity?\n---\n[Date]: 08-28-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I'm now trying to decide how reasonable this is. It doesn't sound as unreasonable as \"kill everyone regardless of dice roll if we run out of people\" but is it kind of equivalent to that? Market A also has the problem that it contradicts the clarifications in the market description that were there from the start. Namely, that the finite version to use is one where everyone survives if we run out of people. But I agree that now we're not deciding the math but rather how clear the question was. It sounds like you (a mathematician yourself) agree that with the stated clarifications, the answer is 1\/36. Just that you question how clear those clarifications are? No, and that's part of why I'm taking so long to resolve this. I want to get as much clarity as possible on what the controversy and confusion is. Your comment here is helping a lot with that!\n---\n[Date]: 08-28-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  This is extremely helpful. Your Market A directly contradicts FAQ8 but FAQ8 was added later so that may be unfair to NO bettors. I have to think about this more now. I didn't intend conditioning on rolling snake eyes and to me that feels like a different problem but it's making sense to me that that's what people read into the original \"at some point you'll roll snake eyes\".\n---\n[Date]: 08-28-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  My challenge to the NO bettors is to make a version of this market that doesn't do what you object to in this one. My prediction is that it doesn't work! You end up backed into a corner like saying that the finite version of the game involves killing the final group of people whether they rolled snake eyes or not. Or you could claim finite versions are irrelevant but then we're stuck a different way -- the answer is just \"0\/0\".\n---\n[Date]: 08-28-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That's the paradox: the implicit \"unless I roll snake eyes forever\" turns out to matter despite having probability zero. I didn't appreciate that when I created the market. Anyway, I'm not going to resolve YES unless that's the consensus of mathematicians.\n---\n[Date]: 08-24-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Ah, wonderful. And I'm very excited to report that I just had a pretty big epiphany while giving my answer to that poll. See the comments there!  (Oops, wait, very excited but also very embarrassed to belatedly realize that   already had all this in  the YES writeup  that we've been working on merging into a single document!   has really been light years ahead of me on all this all along. Really grateful for all this.) So the very short version is that it turns out that the probability of  never  rolling snake eyes, given that you're chosen to play, is always between 94% and 97% (1-2p to 1-p) no matter how many rounds we cap the game at. That sounds crazy since the unconditional probability of never rolling snake eyes goes to zero but that's what the math says. And intuitively we can make sense of it like this: With an infinite pool I'm certain I won't be chosen, but  if  somehow I'm chosen then the otherwise impossible scenario of rolling non-snake-eyes again and again literally forever actually has a probability of exactly 17\/18. I can't get over how cool this is.\n---\n[Date]: 08-24-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I don't mean to imply anything else with my names -- just wanting a way to distinguish them when talking about them.

How about these names: YES-Biased Snake Eyes The one you previously described where it's explicit that running out of people (or rolling non-snake-eyes forever) means no one dies and we're taking the limit as the pool of people goes to infinity. NO-Biased Snake Eyes This is what you have above where we explicitly rule out outcomes that don't end with a group rolling snake eyes and dying.\n---\n[Date]: 08-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Some good discussion is happening in the comments today! I'm hoping we'll get another market from  @Primer  on Altered Snake Eyes. Seeing if there's consensus on that one should help a lot with untangling the controversy and confusion here, I think.  I also wanted to show how I think about the version of the question in the market description but without any of the clarifications\/FAQ. Maybe this can also shed light on where the YES vs NO folks are diverging, like if a NO bettor could give their version of the following: We're told we have an unlimited number of people to draw from. This is an immediate monkey wrench as there's no such thing as a uniform distribution over an infinite set. But uniform is implied since nothing else is specified. You'd definitely have to state it if you were choosing people from the pool in any way other than uniformly. So we could give up here and say the question is self-contradictory. Since the question only allows for 1\/36 or ~1\/2 as answers, we have to fix the question to be able to answer YES or NO. The standard thing to do for a question about infinity that has no direct answer (like \"what's 1 divided by infinity?\" for example) is to take a limit. What's the finite version of this game in terms of some N such that letting N go to infinity gives us the original game? The key choice to make in defining that game is what happens if you don't roll snake eyes before running out of people. In the original game, never rolling snake eyes would mean an infinite number of people all surviving. So the finite version should have that property too: if you never roll snake eyes before running out of people, no one dies. That also makes sense because killing people specifically due to a roll of snake eyes is central to the setup. Killing a group of people on non-snake-yes just because we've run out of people for a subsequent group would be a big deviation, even though in the limit it's all the same. It would be the wrong thing to take the limit of. In conclusion, we're asking about the limit of the finite game where running out of people (which in the limit won't happen) means no one dies. I think the clarifications in the market description are consistent with all that. I just thought it might help to show why I think there wasn't any real choice in making those clarifications.\n---\n[Date]: 08-23-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: This is where I'm confused about the confusion. Does my market description not clarify exactly that? \"The question is about the unrealistic case of an unbounded number of people but we can cap it and say that if no one has died after N rounds then the game ends and no one dies. We just need to then find the limit as N goes to infinity, in which case the probability that no one dies goes to zero.\" That wasn't worded the greatest and so at some point I changed it but I got feedback that that felt unfair so I put it back. But it still seems clear to me. I agree this would be really interesting to know. It's true for me! Could I twist your arm to create a market for Altered Snake Eyes? I'm happy to do so, I'm just worried about perception of bias from me. How so? Not that I intend to resolve N\/A but hypothetically in that case, all trades would be unwound. Maybe you mean opportunity costs? I guess damage there is limited, thanks to loans. As for your crux, I think you're saying that in your interpretation of this market's question, there's no such thing as a finite version of the game where you run out of people? I believe FAQ 3 clarifies this. But let me add a separate comment to step through my reasoning for a version of this question with no clarifications at all. [Now done, see above.]\n---\n[Date]: 08-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Ok, phew. I think the \"undefined\" people are making a confusing philosophical case, or possibly language-lawyering. I don't understand them yet. To me the clarifications clearly rule out \"undefined\". But 1\/2 is great. I think\/hope this means a disagreement about the math itself and exactly one of us will turn out to be right.  So what do you think of my argument in my recent comment starting with \"What if we reason just in terms of the expected value of...\"?\n---\n[Date]: 08-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Do you think the correct answer is ~1\/2 or that it's \"undefined\"?\n---\n[Date]: 08-23-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I agree that that version was what I intended. Sounds like where I went wrong in my market description was to lead with \"unlimited pool of players\"? I didn't know it when I first created the market but before anyone traded I realized that the answer with an unlimited pool is \"undefined\" and so I clarified about the limiting process to use to have it be defined. I think that ends up the same as your Altered Snake Eyes. So I apologize for the more convoluted than necessary problem statement. What I don't understand yet is how anyone gets led astray by that. Does anyone actually feel led astray? I'd like to hear from someone who says that the answer to Altered Snake Eyes is 1\/36 but the answer to Original Snake Eyes is ~1\/2. I kind of think it would be a huge concession from the NO bettors to say that the answer to Altered Snake Eyes is 1\/36 but either way it would be huge progress in understanding the controversy on this. (Maybe it's worth having Altered Snake Eyes be its own market?)\n---\n[Date]: 08-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Contradicts the paradox statement? That's what it means to be a paradox. Both answers are seemingly solid but contradict each other. But also, I didn't say that \"a group always eventually dies\" was wrong. It's always (in the sense of having 100% probability, but there's a subtlety here) the case that a group eventually dies. What's wrong is this: In a weighted average of an infinite number of fractions, if only 1 out of infinity of those fractions is less than 1\/2 then the weighted average must be greater than or equal to 1\/2.\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: What if we reason just in terms of the expected value of the fraction of people chosen who die?  Tempting but wrong is to reason that a group always eventually dies and since that group has more people than all previous groups, the fraction is always (unless you roll non-snake-eyes forever, which has 0% probability) greater than 50% and so on average the fraction has to also be greater than 50%.  Why is that wrong? Because you don't average fractions that way. You have to sum up the numerators and denominators separately. Equivalently, you have to do a weighted average, weighted by the denominators (in addition to weighting by the probabilities). But now that 0% probability case of rolling non-snake-eyes forever involves an infinite number of people chosen and all surviving. Infinity times zero is not necessarily zero. We can't just ignore that case in our calculations. How do we account for it? By taking a limit. Imagine a pool of 10^100 people or however many gazillion rounds. Only in the astoundingly unlikely event that the game lasts that long does everyone survive. But now when we average those survival rates, the astoundingly unlikely one with 100% survival gets massively weighted, because it includes such a massive number of people. So we just need to math that out for arbitrary N and then see what happens in the limit as N goes to infinity. I'm interested to hear from NO bettors on whether they disagree with anything above or whether they accept all that and just disagree that said mathing yields 1\/36.\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Is this what you consider a wall of text redefining the question: My contention is that there's no other clarification that makes sense.

I very much encourage people to make the version of the question they think this should've been. I have a couple candidates myself in the list of related markets, in particular the ball-and-urn version and the anthropic version.\n---\n[Date]: 08-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yeah, when I first created the market I didn't understand that the answer in the case of an unlimited pool of people was technically undefined. I then added clarifications (this was before anyone started trading so I consider it part of the original question) such that we're actually talking about the limit of what I believe is the most natural finite version of the game. Namely, you maintain the property that people are only killed when snake eyes is rolled. If snake eyes is never rolled, no one dies. That's implicit even in the original unbounded version: if hypothetically you rolled non-snake-eyes forever, then an infinite number of people would play and none would die. So I don't think there's much choice about what the finite version of the game is and in any case I spelled it out all along. It's the one where no one dies if you run out of people. I think the heart of the question is whether the game becomes a bad gamble as you become sure that it's going to end in most of the players dying. The big surprise for me was that it stays a good gamble no matter how big the pool of people. As long as there's some chance of everyone surviving, the probability that you personally will die (given you're chosen to play) stays at 1\/36. In the limit when there's  zero  chance of everyone surviving, that conditional probability is still 1\/36. Intuitively, you have zero chance of being chosen to play out of an infinite pool but if you are then maybe the zero-probability scenario of rolling non-snake-eyes forever actually happened.  More intuition-building: Zero probability doesn't mean impossible. Out of the infinite pool,  someone  is getting chosen so why not you? Similarly, every particular infinite sequence of dice rolls has zero probability but one of them is still the one that ends up rolled. So why not one that's all non-snake-eyes forever? That's not rigorous, you say? I agree! So how do we make it rigorous? We take a limit. (But all of that assumes my and  's math is right in our YES write-ups. That's still in dispute.)\n---\n[Date]: 08-21-2023\n[Likes] 0\n[Text]:  See discussion below but the short version is just that I'm not ready with gathering the mathematician(s) to adjudicate it.

The answer would be literally \"undefined\". So this market is about limit of the finite version. Namely, what's the conditional probability with a finite pool of people, such that running out of people without having rolled snake eyes means no one dies? Now take the limit as the size of that pool goes to infinity. (The probability of death goes to 1 in the limit and yet, confusingly, you can't condition on that.)\n---\n[Date]: 08-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  We're very much betting on what mathematicians will say.\n---\n[Date]: 07-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Ooh, thank you! I like your approach to factoring out the confusion with the doubling groups by considering a version with one person at a time taken from a pool and dying on a fair coin flip. (As before, we stop when someone dies.) And you propose 2 ways to interpret that: (1) Given that the process reaches person n, what are the chances they die? (2) Given that person n (call him Bob) flipped the coin, what are the chances he dies? So, um, now I'm confused because those sound identical to me. The two ways you answer them are: (1) 50% by definition. (2) Work out a sum over all possible number of flips, as follows. First, compute the probability that exactly k people flipped the coin, i.e, that we flipped k-1 tails and then a deadly heads, so  1\/2^k . Next, given that we flipped the coin k times, and Bob got one of those k flips, compute the probability Bob got the heads, so  1\/k . Multiply those together and sum up from k=1 to infinity. Turns out the answer is the natural log of 2 or 69%!  So that's interesting, but I think (2) is wrong? (Or that I don't understand the version of the question to which (2) is the answer.) I have to think more about why...\n---\n[Date]: 07-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Sorry for my slowness on some of the open questions here, and on recruiting a mathematician to adjudicate.   and I have joined forces and have made a ton of progress behind the scenes on disentangling a lot of confusion on this. Stay tuned! Also, randomly, I don't know where this came from originally but it cracked me up, even though I don't think it's fair to characterize much of this particular debate this way: And speaking of trying to generate better intuitions, how about a version of this game where you're almost sure to lose each round. So p=0.999 instead of 1\/36. Say there's a lottery ticket with a tiny chance of a huge payout that costs $10. And say that's too expensive for such a tiny chance, so you don't want to play the one-shot version. But now we set up the doubling groups -- as soon as a group loses, we stop, but otherwise we keep minting exponentially more and more millionaires. If we start with an astronomical pool of players then the only way you have any hope of being chosen is that lots of people win the lottery and the doubling groups manages to use up a decent fraction of the vast pool. Which means, of all the people chosen to play, almost half of them win! Does this change your mind and make you willing to pay your $10 should you be chosen to play this lottery? I'm not sure we accomplished much by changing the value of p like that -- it's all the same structure -- but it does somehow feel less surprising in this lottery version that the right answer is that doubling groups doesn't actually change your odds.\n---\n[Date]: 07-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I see that I am being mocked :( and I'd just like to implore Martin or Primer to make a version of this market that gets these things right. One possible such version is  anthropic snake eyes . That one includes instructions not to trade until everything is satisfactorily clarified so I'm hoping it can be edifying in terms of what I should do (or should've done -- sometimes it's too late if later clarifications just end up muddying the waters more and more) in this market.\n---\n[Date]: 07-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Confirmed! I've just been wanting to get my head further around anthropics before being sure that it doesn't bear on this question. My feeling so far is that it doesn't, that anthropics is for the case that you have to condition on your own existence. Martin Randall is casting snake eyes that way but it seems unnecessary or maybe wrong. You still exist whether you're chosen or not. And we can just calculate everything from an outside perspective, pick an arbitrary person, and... well, exactly as you say. (Or maybe we could make a version of the problem where there's not a fixed pool of people, a subset of which is chosen, but rather an empty universe into which people are brought into existence as needed to form new groups. I guess this is what Martin Randall assumed all along and now I feel silly that I'm only now appreciating the distinction!) Thanks also for perfect explanation of \"given\" for conditional probability. Maybe I'll copy that into the FAQ. I'm nervous about upsetting people by seeming to change the question but I don't know how else to get us on the same page about what's actually being asked. Maybe that's a losing battle at this point. I'd love to let the NO bettors make a version of this market that resolves the various ambiguities in the problem statement in a way they feel is most fair.

Sleeping Beauty seems to count as such -- it's not literally her existence but her consciousness and hearing of the question. It wouldn't work without wiping her memory. For snake eyes, we can avoid any of that. Take a pool of people, mark one of them as \"you\" and let the random process play out.

You'll almost always make a small amount of money, but in the rare case that you lose enough times in a row, you lose so much that it undoes all those gains, on average. So in the limit the house edge is still that same constant. Intuitively, the infinite bankroll case has to account for the probability-measure-zero-but-not-impossible case of losing all your bets forever, ie, losing your whole infinite bankroll. If you say \"that can't happen so we can ignore it\" ... well, not so simple! We have to weight our gains\/losses by the probability they happen. So in the infinite bankroll case we have to multiply an infinite loss by a zero probability. Infinity times zero can be anything -- we have to take a limit to find out what. I think that's the heart of the NO bettors' misconception: assuming that anything times zero is zero.\n---\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: But that would contradict the description which explicitly said that NO requires an answer greater than 1\/36. My intention from the start was to disambiguate, via specifying a limiting process, such that the problem necessarily had a numerical answer. Then the idea was to bet on what that answer was. So if I failed at that (I don't think I did, but hypothetically) then that sounds like an argument for an N\/A resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Yes but the market description says that we're going with the former.

I encourage you to make a market that phrases the question in a way that removes the ambiguity -- I think that would be a helpful point of comparison. I'm doing my best in this market.  As for FAQ3's use of \"can\", I've answered this a couple times in the comments, which I understand are hard to trawl through at this point, so let me say it again here and then I can add a note in the description: I think that any interpretation of \"this is technically undefined but we can cap it (to make it defined); then we need to take a limit\" besides \"this is how we're going to make this unambiguous\" would make the whole thing an evil trick question. I'm working as hard as I can to make this the opposite of that. Another stab at rephrasing FAQ3: If anyone has what they think would be a fairer version of FAQ3, I'm interested to hear. Also,   and   and   and  : I think it would help to hear your answers to my \"snibgiblets\" question as well here in the comments. It parallels the snake eyes paradox in a couple key ways but the paradox itself in that version is trivial, so if we're on the same page for that version, that might be real progress.\n---\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: What do people think about this problem: You have some real number of snibgiblets. The pope has precisely 36 times as many snibgiblets as you. We want to convert your number of snibgiblets into a percentage of the pope's number. When your number of snibgiblets is zero, what is that percentage? (Clarification: We can't divide zero by zero but we can take a limit. As your snibgiblet count goes to zero, what is your percentage in the limit?) Argument for 100%: If you have zero snibgiblets then you have exactly as much as someone else with zero. Argument for 1\/36: Say your snibgiblet number is x. By definition the pope's number is 36x. So we want the limit as x goes to 0 of x\/(36x) which is 1\/36. I think without the clarification the most correct answer is \"undefined\". But the clarification makes 1\/36 correct. I think that's equally true for the snibgiblets problem as for the snake eyes paradox.\n---\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Right, it depends how we generalize it. In the version I relayed above, you pick 1 out of 10 on heads and 9 out 10 on tails. If we generalize that to 1 out of n and n-1 out of n then the conditional probability is 1\/n. It seems weird to generalize it to 1 out of n and 9 out of n. Why 9? But we could cover all bases and further generalize to 1 out of n and k out of n. None of this matters though. In the coin flip game, conditioning on being chosen means probably you won. I guess we can keep hashing that out in the other market. I think here we should presume we're on the same page about probability basics like conditional probability (I say, already halfway down this new rabbit hole).\n---\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I picked ten for concreteness but everything I said generalizes straightforwardly to arbitrary pool size.

Your example is an entirely tractable finite scenario so that should be doable, right? My version is below, which (I presume) outputs 1\/10. What's the version that outputs 1\/2? I'm hoping that will clarify what you meant by \"given you are chosen to play, what is the probability you lose?\". (If there's no such procedure -- or it only works for an obviously unreasonable interpretation of the question -- then I hope you'll concede that 1\/2 can't be the answer!) Simulation algorithm: Repeat the above a million times, from scratch each time. Pick a person -- without loss of generality have it be person 1 -- and count the number of trials in which the person was marked chosen. Call that C. Now count the number of trials in which that person lost and call that L. Output L\/C. That's the probability of losing when we restrict attention to worlds in which you were chosen.\n---\n[Date]: 07-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Great questions. The first one is the key. The surprising answer is no, if n people are chosen, they might all survive, because we never rolled snake eyes and then we ran out of people to play. If there are an infinite number of people then we could (in some sense) roll non-snake-eyes forever and have no one die. Sure, that has probability zero, but so does every specific sequence of dice rolls. So we have to approach this problem by taking a limit. Suppose we have a huge number of people such that there's  essentially  no chance of running out of people before rolling snake eyes. Now we ask, given that I was chosen to play, what is the probability I will roll snake eyes? Conditioning that way, the \"essentially no chance\" becomes a pretty good chance. We Bayes this out and find that, sure enough, the conditional probability is always 1\/36. If we try to reason about the infinite case directly, we have 0% percent chance of being chosen, which is hard to condition on. But intuitively, I know I won't be chosen but if somehow I am, then rolling snake eyes forever becomes plausible. That's the one way for all infinite number of people to be chosen. Is that making sense?\n---\n[Date]: 07-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Come to think of it, I'd love to confirm that   and   and   agree with my answer to your probability problem. Let me repeat it here to make it easier for them: The setup is I'm one of 10 people and a fair coin is flipped. On heads 1 person is uniformly randomly chosen and that person loses. On tails, 9 people are uniformly randomly chosen and they all win. The question is how how likely I am to have lost, after updating on the evidence that I was chosen. Or we could simulate it: of the times I'm chosen, what fraction of those times do I lose? First intuitively, thinking like a Bayesian, I consider how surprised by the evidence I am in different possible worlds. In the possible world where I lose, I only had a 1\/10 chance of being chosen. In the possible world where I win, I had a 9\/10 chance of being chosen. Being chosen is much less surprising in the world where I win. So being chosen is strong Bayesian evidence that I win! Definitely more than 50% probability. Now to carefully Bayes it out: Pr(lose | chosen) = Pr(chosen | lose) Pr(lose) \/ Pr(chosen) = Pr(lose) \/ Pr(chosen). So we just need the priors, which are straightforward. To lose we need to flip heads and then be the unlucky one of ten. And being chosen is either 10% or 90% depending on the coin flip so we just average those. Pr(lose) = 1\/2 * 1\/10 = 1\/20. Pr(chosen) = 1\/2 * 1\/10 + 1\/2 * 9\/10 = 1\/2. And that's it. Plug those in and the answer is 1\/10 -- only a 10% chance of losing. Woo-hoo! (And in the limit as that 10 goes to infinity, knowing you were chosen makes you certain that you won.)\n---\n[Date]: 07-15-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for making this!

Namely, \"we did not end the game in death nor run out of people before getting to you\". Or simply: \"you got the chance to roll the dice\". In the one-shot game, that's just trivially always true. In any finite, multi-round version, the probability is goes down from 100% but set n=1 and we have the one-shot version -- there's nothing special about it. In the infinite version, there's a 0% chance of being chosen so we have to untangle how to condition on a thing we're sure won't happen, which we do by taking a limit. So I think that's the error in  's proof. It treats the one-shot version as the only special case where rolling snake eyes doesn't necessarily happen. But never-rolling-snake-eyes is possible for any finite version of the game and, in the limit, for the infinite version as well.   is correctly solving a different problem: what is the probability of dying given that you're chosen and the game does eventually end with snake eyes?\n---\n[Date]: 07-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: More on the confusing FAQ8: It's correct to say \"if I flip a coin long enough, at some point I'll get heads\" even though we understand that \"all tails forever\" is one of the infinitely many sequences of possible coin flips. I think a lot of people have been betting NO on this market because of the bit in the original problem statement that says \"at some point we'll roll snake eyes\". If it had said \" given  that at some point we roll snake eyes\" then that's a different story. When the game ends in snake eyes, half the people chosen to play die.  And it always does end in snake eyes, boom done, right? Wrong! For any finite version of the game, we may run out of people to potentially kill and the game may end with no snake eyes. And that's true in the limit as well: we may roll non-snake-eyes forever. That has probability zero but it's one of the infinitely many things that could happen. Trying to reason about the infinite case directly has us taking infinity times zero. But that doesn't mean the answer is \"undefined\". As the problem stipulates, it means we take a limit.\n---\n[Date]: 07-13-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   I've lost track of where I said this before but if the answer is \"undefined\" then the answer to the question in the market's title is \"no\" but the answer to the question in the description is \"n\/a\". This is because I failed to consider the possibility of \"undefined\" as a possible answer when I created the market. Mea culpa! Hopefully the conclusion will be that Pr(death | chosen) is not undefined and this will be moot. If that probability is undefined, then we'll have to hash out what the most fair resolution is.\n---\n[Date]: 07-13-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I continue to be hugely impressed by your work on this.

I think a lot of the NO advocates are wrongly presuming that zero times infinity is zero -- a very easy error to make! Thinking in terms of the limit from FAQ3, there's a minuscule probability of a staggering number of people all surviving. And by conditioning on being chosen, the probability is not as minuscule. So it's never the case that  in expectation  half the participants to die, despite that being usually the case. Actually, remind me, has anyone computed the expected value of the fraction of those chosen who die? I originally assumed that was necessarily the same as the conditional probability but it may be worth seeing that spelled out.\n---\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Discussing that in the  meta-market .\n---\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Status update: Huge thanks to everyone for the amazing discussion here!

So version 2, if you take the limit as N goes to infinity, does also converge to the infinite game. The point where you kill everyone no matter the dice roll never happens. And your Pr(death | chosen) starts at 1 for N=1 and converges to 1\/2 as N goes to infinity (I think?). It's just that it's so different in spirit from the original where you need to roll snake eyes to die. Here's another stab at rationalizing version 1: The heart of the paradox is how, with a big enough pool of people, it seems like we can ignore the possibility of rolling non-snake-eyes over and over so many times that we run out of people. Make the pool of people so absurdly large that rolling non-snake-eyes enough times in a row to exhaust the pool is less likely than golfing a hole-in-one from space. It seems safe to ignore that tiny probability and reason that, since half the people chosen to play are nearly certainly going to die, you shouldn't play. Your own probability of death given that you're chosen must be ~1\/2. Surprisingly, that's not true! No matter how large you make that finite pool, your probability stays 1\/36. It seems to contradict the fact that half the people chosen essentially always die, but it doesn't. It's mindbendy even without a literal infinity. Version 2, by contrast, is boring. You definitely don't want to play the one-shot version (it's certain death) and playing for any small N seems pretty bad. For extremely large N, you can reason that the whole-group-dies-regardless scenario becomes vanishingly unlikely, so maybe you're tempted. But don't forget to condition on being chosen! Being chosen is Bayesian evidence that the vanishingly unlikely scenario happened after all. The just-kill-everyone clause dominates at any scale and we have a consistent conclusion: don't touch the game with a bargepole. Version 1 is the interesting one.\n---\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for this. While I'm chewing on it, could we stake out some common ground that might help with some parallel debates happening here in the comments? Or call it a sanity check before finding the crux of our potential disagreement. Namely, do we agree that for the particular finite version of the game from FAQ3 -- where running out of people means no one dies -- that for that finite game, Pr(death | chosen) = 1\/36?

I claim that that eliminates the ambiguities, but I may not be understanding you yet.\n---\n[Date]: 07-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   Yes but! Knowing that you are chosen is also Bayesian evidence that we didn't roll snake eyes early on. If we had, you probably wouldn't have been chosen. You're more likely to be chosen in the last round, as you say, but also the last round is more likely to not be snake eyes.  Wait, you say, isn't the last round always snake eyes by definition? Not in the finite version (see again FAQ3). So that's the first thing to get on the same page about, the first couple finite cases: And then if we think hand-wavily about the infinite version, the key is that even there the game doesn't necessarily have to end in snake eyes. We could roll non-snake-eyes forever. (It's no less likely than any other specific sequence of dice rolls after all!) The unconditional probability of non-snake-eyes-forever is zero but now consider when we condition on being chosen. If the game ended in snake eyes then a finite number of people were chosen and an infinite number of people  weren't  chosen. But  you  were chosen. So that's surprising to find yourself in the finite group rather than the infinite group. Which is to say that being chosen is Bayesian evidence that the game went forever without ever rolling snake eyes. I say \"hand-wavily\" because we're doing 0 divided by 0 or infinity times 0 all over the place there, which is why we have to consider the finite case and take the limit. But first I think we should finish getting on the same page about the probability in the 2-round, 3-person case. I get Pr(death | chosen) = 1\/36 for that case. It looks like you get ~52%? Actually, what about this as the simplest possible starting point: In your writeup, if I plug in N=0 for the 1-round, 1-person case, I get just under 52% for Pr(death | chosen). If we agree that that's wrong, maybe you could patch that in your writeup or set me straight on why I can't plug in N=0 before we delve deeper?\n---\n[Date]: 07-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Only if you have a solution other than \"undefined\/indeterminate\". Because if that's the answer then this part of the original problem statement covers it: Let me try rephrasing the above: So you may be objecting that the infinite version is in fact well posed and we don't have to take that limit? Or I made a poor choice for the finite version of the game? If you spell out any such objections I'll try to make things fair.\n---\n[Date]: 07-11-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I do think that the \"we can\" has an implicit \"and so we will\" because it's in the context of how we can make the question answerable. Actually Martin Randall asked about that early on and this was my reply: But also I don't want to dictate anything and if you have a solution that avoids taking a limit, I want to hear that too. It's just that I believe that if we don't take a limit then the answer is \"undefined\/indeterminate\" so I guess it's more like \"we can and we have to\". But as always, I'm open to counterarguments.\n---\n[Date]: 07-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Wait, new possible crux: You always have to consider the case that snake eyes is never rolled. So we start, as you say, by saying you're guaranteed to be chosen in the 2-round game. Now we consider all the possible dice rolls: The unconditional probabilities of those cases are  1\/36  ,  35\/36*1\/36  ,  35\/36*35\/36  but what we need are the conditional probabilities, conditioning on being chosen. Is that making sense so far?\n---\n[Date]: 07-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Ah, yeah, so I think the ordering is key somehow? Considering your simpler example, the way it works in my writeup is that you learn you're guaranteed to be chosen and that fact makes it less likely that snake eyes is rolled early. If we fix the round where snake eyes is rolled then you're probably going to die. But it's not fixed.\n---\n[Date]: 07-10-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I strongly second everything   said. I might be missing something in your argument. The finite counterpart of an infinite sequence of non-snake-eyes is a finite sequence consisting entirely of non-snake-eyes -- so no one ends up dying. This is key for setting up the limit. But I guess that's the crux? As you argue in  your writeup  (thank you!) there exist cases where taking a limit can mislead us. In particular the staircase paradox, where a staircase converges to a diagonal line in the limit but the length of the staircase converges to something we know is wrong. So your claim, I think, is that we're not justified in taking the limit described in FAQ3? One sanity check: Can you name an example (maybe some real-world instance of evaluating something like x^2\/x as x approaches zero?) where taking a limit  is  justified? Then we can delve into how to decide when taking a limit is vs isn't justified? (Then separately we can debate what that means for this market, since FAQ3 is part of the problem statement. Maybe that's a debate about whether I asked the wrong question?)\n---\n[Date]: 07-10-2023\n[Likes] 0\n[Text]:  Makes sense. Can we walk through the 2-round, 3-person case? There are two ways to be chosen: you are either in the first group (probability  1\/3 ) or the second group (probability  35\/36*2\/3 ). Given that one of those happened -- the guarantee that you're chosen -- what's the probability you die? Are you getting something other than 1\/36 here?\n---\n[Date]: 07-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Ooh, I may have spotted where we've diverged (I'm behind on your formal writeup and the ongoing discussion with   but it all looks extremely high quality and like we're making real progress on getting on the same page! thank you!): Not a guarantee! The game ends when a group dies and that might happen before I'm chosen.

It's only a veridical paradox so it goes away when you find the right way to think about it. For many of us, that's been quite a struggle! A gratifying one though. I'm learning a lot from this. So, yes, it technically is nonsensical to talk about starting with a literally infinite number of people (there's no such thing as sampling uniformly from an infinite set, for starters) and so the only interpretation we can make is as a limit as the set grows arbitrarily large. And that turns out to be relatively straightforward. The trickiest part for me was, where the heck does the argument based on the fraction of people who end up dead go wrong? With St Petersburg, one way to resolve the paradox is to have diminishing marginal utility for money. But we can unresolve it by saying your actual utility doubles on each successful dice roll. In that case the expected value of the game really does go to infinity in the limit. But, as you say, if you just factor in a cap -- the maximum amount the casino can give you -- then the expected value of the game is eminently reasonable. And I think the seeming paradox is similar to the snake eyes paradox: you'd think you could ignore the vanishingly unlikely event that the casino runs out of money, but you can't.\n---\n[Date]: 07-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for the contributions! The clarifications as currently articulated are the only way I know to rigorously pose the question. If the question were interpreted as \"given that the game ends in death...\" then the death probability for the finite version starts at 1 (for a pool of people big enough to play 1 round) then is 2\/3 for 2 rounds, etc, asymptotically approaching 1\/2 in the limit. So no paradox there either, just a changing probability from peeking at the dice. And that version would contradict the rest of the problem statement (and I think the spirit of it, which is \"knowing nothing about future dice rolls, do you want to play the infinite version?\") as clarified before anyone started betting. What's mind-bendy for me still is, we know with probability 1 that the infinite game ends in death, so how is  not  ok to condition on that? It's not but it feels like it should be, hence the paradox, at least in my mind.\n---\n[Date]: 07-07-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  How about making a new market with your writeup as the market description?

It doesn't converge to the actual diagonal, just something that looks like it. Next, the seeming contradiction that you individually want to play this game but you don't want all humans to play. That need not be paradoxical. Maybe all or most humans are happy to take a pill that gives them superpowers with 99% probability and kills them with 1% probability. But if everyone takes that pill, a 1% chance of human extinction is way too high. There's no paradox or contradiction, it's just that the disutility of n human deaths is more than n times the disutility of 1 death when n is a sizable fraction of the total human population.  But there may be more to it than that if it really is the case that even individually you don't want to play the doubling-groups version of the snake eyes game. As I said in the derivative market, I'd like to get my head fully around the above two questions before recruiting a mathematician to adjudicate this.\n---\n[Date]: 07-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for writing this up!

That's not a contradiction.\n---\n[Date]: 07-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I haven't figured out how to justify this yet but my intuition is screaming that the doubling can't ever affect your decision making and that there's no knife edge. If I'm wrong then I  really  want to understand how the decision can hinge on something besides that conditional probability.  The seeming knife edge is how if you peek into the future to learn that snake eyes is rolled within the first billion rounds -- something you were already almost sure of -- then your odds of death change from 1\/36 to 1\/2. I'm thinking there must be a flaw there. [hand-waving commences] The only way to make that coherent is to modify the game to say that if we get to the billionth round without snake eyes then we just force a snake-eyes roll and kill the last enormous group. You definitely don't want to play anymore because that modification, unlikely as it is to matter, is more likely to matter in worlds where you're chosen to play. I know you're saying there's no modification of the game, you just learn for certain a fact you were already almost sure of. But... Oof, yeah, this is why this paradox is so great. It just won't stop flipping back and forth in my brain! Nonetheless, I'm registering the meta-prediction that (somehow) it's still rational to play after peeking into the future to learn that snake eyes are rolled within a billion rounds. If not, I think my confidence in this market resolving YES would plummet.\n---\n[Date]: 07-02-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  It's a veridical paradox (I think!).

For normal numeric markets the mapping is (X - min) \/ (max - min). For log scale numeric markets, the mapping is scaled logarithmically to be more granular near 0% and 100%. There's no reason these need be the only two options; Manifold could let the market creator specify any mapping function rather than only letting us pick between two specific options. (I think this would primarily be useful for numeric markets on outcomes that have a weird distribution where you want more granularity somewhere that isn't either extreme of the scale.)\n\nFor some reason, numeric markets don't work properly with small ranges. Trying to create a market with a min of 1 and a max of 2 for fine-grained betting results in very low liquidity. I'm not sure why this is, since such a market should be completly isomorphic to a market with a larger range, just scaled down.\n\nGiven the equivalence between binary and numeric markets, Manifold could let us pick whether there's a percentage sign displayed or not. This could be used for markets on events that are known to have a near-0 or near-1 probability; you could create a 0%-100% market on a log scale. Allowing us to display other units, such as currency symbols would be nice. So would a \"date\" unit, where the underlying market is just a numeric market on unix time or whatever, but it displays as a human readible date.\n\nMany binary markets have two roughly equivalent primary outcomes. For example, whether a democrat or a republican president wins the election. Right now, we have to arbitrarily pick one option to highlight in the market, such as \"Will a democrat win the election?\". This is inelegant and skews the market, since it could bias how traders think about the result, and an unexpected result (like an independent candidate winning) will favor one side or the other. This can be solved by using a multiple-choice market instead and creating only two choices. However, multiple-choice markets have a much worse market-making algorithm (you're not guaranteed your payouts when you place a bet) and worse UI (you can't see shares held, can't place limit orders, can't sell any number of shares, etc). This could be fixed by improving multiple-choice markets and\/or giving us the option to label binary markets outcomes with labels other than \"YES\" and \"NO\".\n\nOften there are colors associated with certain market outcomes, such as blue for democrats and red for republicans. But market graphs don't let us pick their colors; on binary markets we're stuck with green and white, and on multiple-choice markets we're stuck with a predetermined selection. Letting the market creators choose what colors represent which options would be a nice aesthetic improvement, and also make it easier for people to hold in their mind what option means what.\n\nIn short, there's a lot of overlap between different market types and use-cases, and a lot of things that it seems like we should able to do that we can't. This market resovles YES if we get a significant number of these options available to us.\n\nFor example, if two-option multiple-choice markets are given the same market mechanism and usability features as binary markets, and we're able to change the graph colors, and low-range numeric markets start working, that would be sufficient to resolve this to YES, even if we don't get the ability to use custom mapping functions. (Unless we lose other options that cancel out those improvements.)\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 12-19-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Nah, those are both tangential, not the core market structure.\n---\n[Date]: 10-18-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The unification of free response and multiple choice markets into a single market type with more granular control over percentages and who can add answers is a big step in this direction, but it's not enough for a YES resolution.

Thank you manifold staff for supporting this. Allowing the markets to continue to exist while improving my browsing experience seems like the best way forward. Cheers!\n---\n[Date]: 07-03-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Alright, I've seen one nonpredictive market since the weekend began, and it was appropriately tagged. I'm going to start the approx 1 week clock for continued monitoring. If there are no betters, this is the time to collect evidence that the issue is still pervasive. At the moment the market is going to resolve yes unless I see proper evidence the problem is continuing. If I am doubting the situation then I may pause resolution or allow the market to continue.  Either way, at the moment my manifold experience has improved :)\n---\n[Date]: 07-02-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I think because the incentive structure was taken away, especially for creation and leader boards, it makes it less attractive.

The tl;dr is I need to believe the solution is an actual crackdown to reduce or solve the problem. This does not mean completely removing them from the website\/app, but can take many forms. I believe yesterday they have reduced the incentive structure for the creation of those markets, which may contribute towards a resolution. If the solution ends up being low impact, is easily sidestepped, or not enforced then the market must stay open.\n---\n[Date]: 06-28-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  they still show up in my feed, although one was tagged as nonpredictive which should hopefully assist condtion 2.

In 2018 unintentionally qualified for UK national championships. Never competed before. Around the same time also started streaming on my crappy laptop for fun to 5-10 viewers. Won said tournament. Got a few hundred followers on Twitter and Twitch from it. Started tryharding much more and used prize money to buy a pc and started streaming more. Went to first year uni where instead of studying biochem I just streamed and travelled to tournaments. 30-50 avg conc viewers. After 1st year took a gap year (bc i was depressed, not bc i wanted to pursue streaming as a career). Hearthdtone battlegrounds came out and i became the rank 1 player in the world for ~4 months. Stream grew to 1k+ conc and started getting sponsors. Streamed Hearthstone as my \"fulltime job\"  on and off while struggling with mental health from 2019 - 2021. Made just enough to have my own 1 bed apartment but wasnt that much and started to bleed money when I would stop for random months. Semi quit for 3 months. Then Storybool Brawl came out. Streamed that for around 9 months. Was much more consistent and mental health was upward trajectory. Feb 2022 I meet austin for the first time when he does a 1 hour paid coaching session. May 2022 Austin reached out asking if I wanted to do a work trial as community manager or if I wanted a sponsorship to promote Manifold to my Twitch stream.

After the discovery of Russian war crimes, Ukraine has put a law in place forbidding any negotiations so long as Putin is in power. Recently, the Ukrainian FM Kuleba stated that \"Russia must face a war-crimes tribunal before his country directly talks with Moscow\", something Russia will certainly not agree to. On the other side, Russia has had a remarkably consistent position since the breakdown of the first stage of peace talks in late March: It says it's prepared to hold peace talks at any moment, Ukraine just has to accept some preliminaries, which, if you read them, more or less boil down to surrender. That's certainly not something Ukraine will agree to. So, at the moment, I don't see any interest in negotiations on either side. However, a year is a long time, and significant military successes for Ukraine, internal troubles or issues with Putin's health could bring changes about in Russia. In Ukraine, I think the most likely (though not necessarily likely in absolute terms) factor might be a significant deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Some of those can cause the sides to drop their maximum demands (which are presumably meant as bargaining chips) and seriously consider negotiations.\n","[Market title] Will Ukraine fulfill its obligations with respect to Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast by 2023?\n[Market description] \"Four other sections address political matters:\n\nArticle 4: elections in Donbas.

The high end is if asteroid mining pans out.  This gives a combined median of 3% and a combined range of -8% to 9%.\n\nRegardless of your thoughts on bitcoin in particular, it should be clear that any fixed-supply global currency people agreed to use would outperform fiat by 6% in expectation over the long run.   Constant supply + constant velocity implies deflation equal to real gdp growth (3%), instead of 3% inflation via QE.   Also making a big assumption here that downward nominal wage rigidity is no big deal and the choice of currency won't affect long-run gdp growth.\n\narbitrage-free interest rate parity requires the depreciating currencies have higher risk-free-rates than appreciating ones, so this analysis doesn't necessarily reflect the total returns realized by the investor.\n\nrelated arb-able markets:\n\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/JonathanRay\/what-will-be-the-relative-change-in-c6b0e4fca80a)\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/JonathanRay\/what-will-be-annualized-nominal-wor)\n[Market creator] Jonathan Ray\n[Creation date] 05-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2100\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Here's an even simpler model with only 2 variables, and separate prediction markets to decompose each of the 2 variables. 1. world nominal GDP growth  (this is the expected change in value if market share stays the same) 2. market share change\n---\n[Date]: 05-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: 1. in the event of a chain split, whichever chain ends up with more float (market cap that is actually in circulation, i.e. 'circulating supply' on coinmarketcap, i.e. market cap minus closely held premines) is the real bitcoin, and the other chain is a new shitcoin. 2.

The definition that I am using, which was implied by    comment , is that the \"bigness\" property of numbers is a comparission of the length as they are written. This definition is borrowed from my intuition of how \u201cbigness\u201d for words is measured (e.g. it seems like people would probably say yes if you asked \u201cis beetle bigger than tiger?\u201d) The main two alternative definitions that I considered were: bigness is a property of magnitude and bigger means greater. The strongest argument to me, in favor of bigness being a property of magnitude, was from   who framed their argument in two ways. The  first  was as a hole with -10 dirt, and a mound with 5 dirt. It\u2019s obvious that the hole is bigger than the mound.  Similarly  if Asiago has -10 YES shares (aka 10 NO shares) and Brie has 5 YES shares, Asiago has more shares. The strongest argument to me, in favor of bigness meaning \u201cgreater,\u201d was from  , who  argued  that if a number X is bigger than a number Y, then it oughta be the case that X + Z is bigger than Y + Z. They noted that if we consider Z = 100, X = -10 and Y = 5, everyone unambiguously agrees that 90 is not bigger than 105, so 5 ought to be bigger than -10. (not explicitly an argument that bigger should mean greater, but ) I am not choosing to resolve based on the first definition since I didn\u2019t really see a good argument in favor of it over any of the others. I am not resolving based on the second because I don\u2019t think that this \u201cadditive bigness\u201d property is necessarily more important than the opposing \u201c bigness is how much of an effect something has \u201d property. Thus I\u2019m resolving NO. (this was a fun market and I feel like \u201cI\u2019ve learnt something\u201d through this process!

This reasoning I find hard to believe. While I think it\u2019s clearly not what you were asking for, I don\u2019t really see it making  no  sense. It seems comparable to a situation such as if someone asks you to pick a number between 1 and 10, and you say \u03c0 + e. It\u2019s obviously not what they were asking for, but \u03c0 + e is still a number between 1 and 10.\n---\n[Date]: 02-28-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think that if you were to ask people, they would likely say that \"loll\" is bigger than \"mow,\" even though mow takes up more room on the page, \"loll\" has more letters, and thus would generally be considered \"bigger.\" I'm (currently) applying the same reasoning to numbers since I don\u2019t have beliefs either way for \u201cbigger\u201d referring to either magnitude or \u201cgreater than,\u201d so I\u2019m choosing the definition that seems most reasonable for words and applying it to numbers. I guess another way of putting that is that I\u2019m about equally convinced by the opposing \"greater than\" and magnitude arguments and for me this word argument tips the scales towards -10 being bigger.\n---\n[Date]: 02-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I still do not have strong beliefs either way, but this is where I stand. Overall, I think that -10 is bigger than 5. I\u2019ve been (weakly) convinced by the arguments that say that for bigness, what matters is how many characters the number has, since there does not seem to be any widely accepted definition for what the property of \u201cbigness\u201d means for negative numbers. The example I have in my mind is if I was asked a question like \u201cIs Tiger bigger than Beetle,\u201d the most reasonable interpretation of that seems to be \u201cno, beetle is bigger\", since beetle has more letters, and that\u2019s what I expect most people would probably answer (before questioning you for not saying \u2018a tiger\u2019 and \u2018a beetle') Yes, I know this means that 10 is as big as 99, and 0.1 is bigger than 1, and I very much dislike these consequences, but currently, this seems like the most sensible way of interpreting the question. NOTE: This is NOT a final decision at all, I do only weakly believe this. However, this is what I currently do believe, and will resolve this question as NO, unless I\u2019m convinced otherwise. \n---\n[Date]: 02-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Er...

The word bigger is mostly meaningless with regards to negative numbers, because negative numbers don\u2019t really have a real world conceptual equivalent (e.g. I can\u2019t say that my pile of -10 marbles is bigger than my pile of 5 marbles, since my pile of -10 marbles doesn\u2019t exist). Furthermore, since I provided no context for my problem, and math jargon is all about context, my question has no meaning.

I think I currently agree that 5 is greater than -10, and I mostly agree with the fact that -10 is larger than 5 (larger magnitude). Currently,   is asserting that bigness is a property of magnitude and   is asserting that \"greater and bigger\" are the same (and thus (presumeably) a property of the ordering of the natrural numbers\/reals).   is arguing that greater and bigger are the same citing the \" cambridge.org  dictionary (since they made the language they are the foremost authority on what words mean).\" If I\u2019ve straw-manned any of y\u2019all in my distillations, uh, \u201csorry,\u201d please correct me.

This question also resolves to YES if AI is otherwise brought up by a candidate in the context of a question unrelated to AI and ALL candidates talk about AI at least once during the same debate, with at least one of the candidates saying \"AI\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"robots\" or a close synonym at least three separate times, at least five seconds apart, during the same debate. Otherwise, this question resolves to NO.\n\nAsking \"at least two separate questions\" means that the moderator must pose two semantically distinct and individual queries, each intended to elicit a unique response, specifically about artificial intelligence. In other words, simply repeating the same question doesn't count as two separate questions, even if the question is asked twice, first to one candidate, and then a second time to the other candidate. Moreover, asking two distinct questions without waiting for the answer to the first one counts as two separate questions for the purpose of this question. For example, a clear positive instance would be asking first, \"How do you plan to manage the existential risks from AI?\" and then later asking, \"What are your proposals to mitigate job loss due to automation from AI?\" These are two separate questions because they cover different facets of artificial intelligence\u2014existential risk and employment. A clear negative example would be if the moderator simply asked, \"How do you plan to manage the existential risks from AI?\" to one candidate, and then later said \"Same question to you\" to the other candidate. Even though the question is asked twice, it's not considered two \"separate\" questions because it's a repetition of the same query.\n\nWhen it comes to questions related to automation and job losses, the key factor that determines whether the question is \"directly related to artificial intelligence\" is whether the moderator mentions AI technologies or AI companies, such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, generative AI, or neural networks; any question will automatically qualify if the moderator says the word \"AI\" or \"artificial intelligence\" in the question. General questions about automation or job losses that don't clearly link back to AI won't be considered \"directly related to artificial intelligence\". For example, the following questions would NOT count as being directly related to artificial intelligence:\n\n\"How will your administration address the growing issue of job losses due to technological advances?\" \u2014 Too broad; doesn't specify AI.\n\n\"What are your plans for helping workers displaced by automation?\" \u2014 Not specific to AI; includes all automation.\n\nIf there are no 2024 general presidential election debates, this question resolves to N\/A.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 01-24-2023\n[Closing data] 11-06-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  There must be two  separate  questions about AI.

This paper  suggests that deep learning hadn't automated many jobs as of 2019; and although the paper is 4 years old, I'd expect similar results if the paper were replicated today. Automation from LLMs and AI art generators is extremely new right now and has only affected a very tiny portion of the labor force. That could dramatically change by the time of the presidential election next year, but I doubt it.\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I'm not sure how clarifying things is worse than keeping the question vague. Can you expand a little bit on your reasoning? It seems to me that I should aim for maximum clarity as early as possible rather than keep people in the dark about how I will resolve the question. This is different from changing the criteria, however, and it seems you acknowledge that too. Overall I don't understand your argument for why I should keep more subjective criteria in place.\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good point. Asking two distinct questions without waiting for the answer to the first one should count as two separate questions in my opinion. I'll likely add that into the clarification, pending objections.\n---\n[Date]: 10-26-2023\n[Likes] 8\n[Text]: Note to predictors: I am considering adding (1) a paragraph clarifying what counts as \"two separate questions directly related to artificial intelligence\", and (2) a paragraph clarifying what counts as a question \"directly related to artificial intelligence\". If you have strong opinions about these changes, please reply to this comment, and I will take your comments into account when deciding to make these changes. I will not make any changes to the question until at least 48 hours have elapsed since I posted this comment. Proposed clarification 1:  \"Asking \"at least two separate questions\" means that the moderator must pose two semantically distinct and individual queries, each intended to elicit a unique response, specifically about artificial intelligence. In other words, simply repeating the same question doesn't count as two separate questions, even if the question is asked twice, first to one candidate, and then a second time to the other candidate. For example, a clear positive instance would be asking first, \"How do you plan to manage the existential risks from AI?\" and then later asking, \"What are your proposals to mitigate job loss due to automation from AI?\" These are two separate questions because they cover different facets of artificial intelligence\u2014existential risk and employment. A clear negative example would be if the moderator simply asked, \"How do you plan to manage the existential risks from AI?\" to one candidate, and then later said \"Same question to you\" to the other candidate. Even though the question is asked twice, it's not considered two \"separate\" questions because it's a repetition of the same query.\" Proposed clarification 2: \" When it comes to questions related to automation and job losses, the key factor that determines whether the question is \"directly related to artificial intelligence\" is whether the moderator mentions AI technologies or AI companies, such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, generative AI, or neural networks; any question will automatically qualify if the moderator says the word \"AI\" or \"artificial intelligence\" in the question. General questions about automation or job losses that don't clearly link back to AI won't be considered \"directly related to artificial intelligence\". For example, the following questions would NOT count as being directly related to artificial intelligence:\n---\n[Date]: 08-07-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I put some info in my bio that should help people.\n---\n[Date]: 08-07-2023\n[Likes] 12\n[Text]: Predictors, in case you were spooked by my latest comment, I want to update you that I have decided to NOT change the criteria.

Well, suppose that I am trying to take candy from a baby. And further suppose that the baby is not able to respond in time. Will my first attempt to take the candy be successful? I don't think this is 99% only because there may be race dynamics with other AIs that are also trying to take over the world, in the scenario where lethal AGI is deployed in parallel. Conditional on humanity deploying a lethal AI and miraculously surviving, the odds that we would be exactly that stupid again seem pretty high to me. Plus the odds of multiple AIs trying to take over the world at once. Plus the odds that the ensuing chaos causes a death spiral.

As manic as the recent hype around ChatGPT has been, it will be a mere prelude to the public reaction when GPT-4 is released. Buckle up.\n\nWhat will GPT-4 be like? Perhaps counterintuitively, we predict that it won\u2019t be much larger than its predecessor GPT-3. In an influential research paper published earlier this year, DeepMind researchers determined that today\u2019s large language models are in fact larger than they should be; for optimal model performance (given a finite compute budget), today\u2019s models should have fewer parameters but train on larger datasets. Training data, in other words, trumps model size.\n\nMost of today\u2019s leading language models were trained on data corpuses of about 300 billion tokens, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 (175 billion parameters in size), AI21 Labs\u2019 Jurassic (178 billion parameters in size), and Microsoft\/Nvidia\u2019s Megatron-Turing (570 billion parameters in size).\n\nWe predict that GPT-4 will be trained on a dataset at least an order of magnitude larger than this\u2014perhaps as large as 10 trillion tokens. \n\nMeanwhile, it will be smaller (i.e., fewer parameters) than Megatron-Turing.\n\nIt is possible that GPT-4 will be multimodal: that is, that it will be able to work with images, videos and other data modalities in addition to text. This would mean, for example, that it could take a text prompt as input and produce an image (like DALL-E does); or take a video as input and answer questions about it via text.\n\nA multimodal GPT-4 would be a bombshell. More likely, however, GPT-4 will be a text-only model (like the previous GPT models) whose performance on language tasks will redefine the state of the art. What will this look like, specifically? Two language areas in which GPT-4 may demonstrate astonishing leaps in performance are memory (the ability to retain and refer back to information from previous conversations) and summarization (the ability to distill a large body of text to its essential elements).\n\nIf you enjoyed this market, please check out the other 9!  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/group\/forbes-2023-ai-predictions\n\nThis market is from Rob Toews' annual AI predictions at Forbes magazine.  This market will resolve based on Rob's own self-assessed score for these predictions when he publishes his retrospective on them at the end of the year.\n\nSince Rob resolved and graded his 2022 predictions before the end of 2022, I am setting the close date ahead of the end of the year, to (try to) avoid a situation where he posts the resolutions before the market closes.  In the event that his resolution post falls in 2024, my apologies in advance.  If he hasn't posted resolutions at all by February 1, 2024, I will do my best to resolve them personally, and set N\/A for any questions that I can't determine with outside source data.\n\n-----\n\nEdit 2023-07-05: Last year Rob used \"Right-ish\" to grade some of his predictions.  In cases of a similar \"Right-ish\" (or \"Wrong-ish\") answer this year, I will resolve to 75% PROB or 25% PROB, respectively.  This will apply for similar language too (\"mostly right\", \"partial credit\", \"in the right direction\").

It is sufficient to successfully integrate existing work that is not yet part of the model. Of course, to be 'recursive' this must be shown to repeat, and there must be evidence that the later generations are capable of advancements that the initial generation was not capable of.\n\nSince this market is getting more interest, I thought I'd put some clarification here. I'm up for having a 3rd party arbiter of this question, details can be arranged closer to the close date. \n\nIf GPT-5 comes out before the stated close of the market, then the market will close as soon as the question can be evaluated. Subtle self-improvements which quickly plateau out, such as has been seen so far with GPT-4 using Reflexion, will not count. The process doesn't need to be entirely 'within' the model, as direct modifications of the model's weights. It could include external code wrappers and memory systems interfacing through an API. The system does need to show multiple steps of clear improvement, where the later steps are demonstrably better at making further improvements than the earlier steps. \n\nAs clarified in the comments, if the recursive self-improvement can't be clearly demonstrated using less than 3% of the FLOPs used in training GPT-5, then it doesn't count.\n[Market creator] Nathan\n[Creation date] 03-31-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2026\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-25-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Some interesting speculation about what might be on the horizon....  https:\/\/youtu.be\/ARf0WyFau0A?si=X3DEqNkqEsp4W1OT\n---\n[Date]: 05-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Relevant:  https:\/\/backtracks.fm\/80000hours\/pr\/2993337c-eb81-11ed-9b30-0e4b8551d893\/150--tom-davidson-mp3.mp3?s=1&sd=1&u=1683319721\n---\n[Date]: 05-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \"CEO Sam Altman has privately suggested OpenAI may try to raise as much as $100 billion in the coming years to achieve its aim of developing artificial general intelligence that is advanced enough to improve its own capabilities, his associates said.\" -  https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt\n---\n[Date]: 05-03-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  Not until we are able to significantly alter our brains with genetic engineering and brain-computer interfaces.

What's important is the lack of plateauing after multiple steps. So, as you mentioned in your comment above, the steps must be cheaper than the ordinary training, and the trend of improvement has to seem at least linear (not slowing) for the range in which we are able to observe it. I believe these two requirements together describe the sort of accelerating process I am trying to pinpoint with the question.\n---\n[Date]: 04-13-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Nice questions.

You can't (yet) set it to running on a given task and say 'keep getting better until you are superhuman at this task you are currently bad at, then give me the superhuman solution'. For that it'll need to be able to do things like get better at learning to learn after realizing that in order to meet its goal it needs to improve itself, and to do that it needs to learn more about how to improve itself. It's possible that someone will create a plugin for GPT-4 that will enable this.

But the paper didn't offer neural transparency into how GPT-J gives directions, we don't know the stored patterns for answering that part - just a neural representation of the brute idea that GOFAI pioneers might've represented with in(Eiffel-Tower, Rome).\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis market reflects the probability that, in the personal judgment of Eliezer Yudkowsky, anyone will have uncovered any sort of data, pattern, cognitive representation, within a text transformer \/ large language model (LLM), whose semantic pattern and nature wasn't familiar to AI and cognitive science in 2006 (to pick an arbitrary threshold for \"before the rise of deep learning\").\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso in 2006, somebody might've represented \"the Eiffel Tower is in France\" by assigning spatial coordinates to the Eiffel Tower and a regional boundary to France.  Idioms like that appear in eg video games long predating 2006.  Nobody has yet identified emergent environmental-spatial-coordinate representations inside a text transformer model, so far as I know; but even if someone did so before the end of 2026 - as mighty a triumph as that would be - it would not (in the personal judgment of Eliezer Yudkowsky) be an instance of somebody finding a cognitive pattern represented inside a text transformer, which pattern was unknown to cognitive science in 2006.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2006 similarly knew about linear regression, k-nearest-neighbor, principle components analysis, etcetera, even though these patterns were considered \"statistical learning\" rather than \"Good-Old-Fashioned AI\".  Identifying an emergent kNN algorithm inside an LLM would again not constitute \"understanding via transparency, within an LLM, some pattern and representation of cognition not known in 2006 or earlier\".  Likewise for TD-learning and other biologically inspired algorithms, including those considered the domain of neuroscience (from 2006 or earlier).\n\n\u00a0\n\nGOFAI and kNN and similar technologies did not suffice to, say, invent new funny jokes, or carry on a realistic conversation, or do any sort of intellectual labor.  The intent of this proposition, if relevant, is to assert that by end of 2026 we will not be able to grasp any inkling of the cognition inside of LLMs by which they do much more than AIs could do in 2006; we will not have decoded any cognitive representations inside of LLMs supporting any cognitive capabilities original to the era of deep learning.  We will only be able to hunt down internal cognition of the sort that lets LLMs do more trivial and old-AI-ish cognitive steps, like localizing the Eiffel Tower to France (or Rome); on their way to completing larger and more impressive tasks, incorporating other cognitive steps; whose representations inside the LLM, even if we have some idea of which weights are involved, have not yet been decoded in a way semantically meaningful to a human.\n[Market creator] Eliezer Yudkowsky\n[Creation date] 09-30-2022\n[Closing data] 02-01-2027\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 06-15-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:   Copycat and Metacat are some of the leading previous explicit, semantically understood algorithms for analogies and analogies between analogies.\n---\n[Date]: 06-15-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I agree with  @NLeseul.\n---\n[Date]: 06-13-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:   This market is not about identifying semantics inside an LLM.

(i.e. \"I've looked at all notable evidence presented by both sides and have upwards of 98% confidence that a certain conclusion is correct, and it doesn't seem likely that any further relevant evidence will be forthcoming any time soon.\")\n\nThis will likely not occur until many years after Covid is no longer a subject of active political contention, and motivations for various actors to distort or hide inconvenient evidence have died down.\n\nI will be conferring with the community extensivly before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another. As some additional assurance, see @\/IsaacKing\/will-my-resolution-of-the-covid19-l\n\n(For comparison, the level of evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change would be sufficient, despite the existance of a few doubts here and there.)\n\nIf we never reach a point where I can safely be that confident either way, it'll remain open indefinitely. (And Manifold lends you your mana back after a few months, so this doesn't negativly impact you.)\n\n\"Come from a laboratory\" includes both an accidental lab leak and an intentional release. It also counts if COVID was found in the wild, taken to a lab for study, and then escaped from that lab without any modification. It just needs to have actually been \"in the lab\" in a meaningful way. A lab worker who was out collecting samples and got contaminated in the wild doesn't count, but it does count if they got contaminated later from a sample that was supposed to be safely contained.\n\nIn the event of multiple progenitors, this market resolves YES only if the lab leak was plausibly responsible for the worldwide pandemic. It won't count if the pandemic primarily came from natural sources and then there was also a lab leak that only infected a few people.\n\nI won't bet in this market.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 09-01-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2040\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-19-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]: By the way, I'm noticing that many people's positions in this market are pretty small relative to their apparent confidence.

I would be willing to resolve against consensus only in the event that it becomes  extremely  clear that the mainstream is wrong, and I can understand the technical aspects of the situation well enough to see this myself. (For an example of this, consider how cryonics is called a pseudoscience because it hasn't yet been tested. This is a basic misunderstanding of what claims cryonics advocates are making, and another basic misunderstanding of how intelligent agents perform inference about the world and the purpose of performing experiments. It seems to be largely motivated by religious beliefs and culturally-ingrained rationalizations about death, not by the relevant details of the actual claim.) I don't have a good enough understanding of biology at the moment to be comfortable declaring that so many biologists are wrong based only on a statistical argument that has nothing to do with the actual details of the virus in question. If the topic stagnates and it seems likely that no more information will be forthcoming then I might start investigating it more seriously myself, but at the moment it makes a lot more sense for me to let other people do that investigation and argument. (I would love to see a biologist respond to the statistical argument though!)\n---\n[Date]: 11-20-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Ok, and all the mainstream scientists saying it was likely a zoonotic origin have shifted my posterior to below 98%. I'm not going to resolve this market based on a single easily-hackable numerical argument. It's not hard to put together a framing under which any desired conclusion is placed at extremely low odds.  Here 's an example.\n---\n[Date]: 11-19-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:   https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/GrtbTAPfkJa4D6jjH\/confidence-levels-inside-and-outside-an-argument\n---\n[Date]: 11-15-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Hopefully one day Manifold will allow us to cash out mana for real money, and then all our effort will finally be worth it.

A US intelligence agency turning up verified documents that explicitly discuss its creation and\/or release would also come pretty close. Definitive evidence of zoonosis is a bit harder, but maybe finding a genetic predecessor in wild bats could do it? Or finding out that there were earlier cases far away from Wuhan? The Chinese government choosing to cooperate fully with a non-politically-driven western investigation and that investigation concluding zoonosis would also be compelling, though I'm sure there would still be concerns they'd destroyed all the evidence or it was created elsewhere. (I don't know all that much about the evidence on its origin at present; I would obviously do a lot more research into it before resolving this market.)\n---\n[Date]: 09-02-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  My hope is that in 5-15 years there will be less political incentive to hide evidence, and we may be able to arrive at a clear answer. If there isn't, the market will just stay open indefinitely, allowing people to win or lose money as new evidence comes out and people's subjective probabilities change. I don't plan on resolving this market if there's still a credible doubt either way. (This likely does bias the market slightly in favor of YES, since it's easier to get definitive evidence that it was lab-created than that it wasn't.)\n---\n[Date]: 09-02-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Is there a particular reason you don't trust me to resolve this market correctly?\n---\n[Date]: 09-01-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Wikipedia and much of the world's media would disagree, so I don't think I can safely call that \"definitive\".\n"],"14":["[Market title] Which blog post or video idea will I publish next? [M$1000 subsidy]\n[Market description] I have a bit of free time these days, and have been neglecting my blog as of late. Luckily, I have some project ideas! But I'm having trouble deciding which one to work on. \n\nIn an ideal world, I'd get all of them done this summer, and each project seems individually pretty doable! But I am no stranger to the planning fallacy, scope creep, and my own perfectionism, and therefore expect each of these to take substantial time and effort. \n\nI'd love suggestions on which of these projects I should pursue most! I'll give a pitch for each option.\n\nIs 69 Unique? The Search for Nice Numbers [video adaptation of the blog post]\n\nI've written two popular blog posts on \"nice numbers\", and @\/Conflux\/will-3blue1brown-publish-a-video-ab may or may not happen. But math videos are maybe more accessible\/potentially-viral than blog posts, and Grant from 3B1B was supportive of the idea of me making my own video about nice numbers and entering it into his third Summer of Math Exposition contest. Could bring the joy of nice numbers to new audiences!\n\nI have the content here, and some visuals\/writing to use as a starting point. I've never made a YouTube video this involved though. SoME3 deadline is Aug 18 so that's a bit of forcing factor. \n\nAin\u2019t a Bad Lie: A Crucimusical Multimedia Experience [video]\n\nThis would be an adaptation of a multi-layered presentation I gave at a \"presentation party\". I don't wanna spoil anything! But I think it's fun...\n\nCould make it a blog post, but am more enthusiastic about recording myself presenting the slideshow (which I could probably do in a sitting), then adding the overture in video editing, which may be more finicky. \n\nOne-Sentence Book Reviews 2022-23 [blog post]\n\nI did this last year, and thought it was reasonably fun and successful! I remember thinking I'd do it again in a year. It's not as flashy as some of the other options, but it might be faster to make. \n\nThe Market Manipulation Podcast (and Tales from Manifold) [blog post]\n\nI've mentioned Manifold on my blog, but have yet to fully introduce it to my audience. This post would link to and describe the first four episodes of the Market Manipulation Podcast, but an ideal version of it would also have some background and fun anecdotes about Manifold - which is potentially the harder part to execute well. \n\nNote that I am expecting y'all to be slightly biased toward this option!\n\nSomething else\n\nMaybe I'll prefer another idea! It counts for this market if it's a nontrivial blog post or internet project. \n\nNote for resolving this market: for the main four options, they won't have to be exactly as described or exactly with the tentative title I wrote - they just have to have the essence of the project, in my judgement. \n\nI will extend this market until I publish my next nontrivial blog post or internet project. But I'd be disappointed with myself if I didn't publish anything within the next few weeks. \n\nGeneral policy for my markets: In the rare event of a conflict between my resolution criteria and the agreed-upon common-sense spirit of the market, I may resolve it according to the market's spirit or N\/A, probably after discussion.\n[Market creator] Conflux\n[Creation date] 07-05-2023\n[Closing data] 08-17-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n---\n[Date]: 08-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: https:\/\/beautifulthorns.wixsite.com\/home\/post\/the-market-manipulation-podcast-five-episodes-five-stories-at-the-conflux-of-serious-and-meme\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: market not updating very much on apparent delays hmm hmm\n---\n[Date]: 07-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I should mention that I won\u2019t do an unpopular option just to spite the market!

(PC's League retirement)\n[Market description] I'm announcing my retirement from the Leagues. I\u2019m tired and believe that the current structure of Leagues does not align with the long-term objectives of Manifold.\n\n\nPart of this is for the Anti-Addiction Challenge. Part of this is because I have hit my goals of doing well in Masters and being in the top 100 profit and market creators, and want to step away and focus on other things. (And it feels nice to go out near the top). But really this post is about Manifold.\n\n\nI have heard that leagues can be demoralizing - from what \u201cleague\u201d you are in to what \u201crank\u201d you have to being \u201cdemoted\u201d. It is displayed at the top of the homepage and your profile to remind us consistently how we are doing. There is a subtle feeling of something like this is how I am valued on this platform.\n\n\nI feel like this doesn\u2019t cater to some groups of users who care less about profits and competing. Some people want to opt-out. And it could be a coincidence, but we have seen users continue to decline since Leagues got introduced in April.\u00a0\n\n\nHere is a vision \/ proposal for where I would like to see Manifold go, and what Leagues can transform into:\n\nRemove Leagues entirely, shift focus back the Leaderboard for specific timeframes, similar to the one we currently have\n\nKeep the ability to see where profits are made and the bets that people made\u00a0with Leagues\n\nBe able to remove categories (e.g. non-predictive markets, whale-baiting) from the leaderboard\n\nRemove Leagues from profile page and homepage, and keep it on a separate page like the Leaderboard currently\n\nHave a tournament section featured similar to Metaculus. This could include Tournaments like ACX, Carson Gale\u2019s, my own. This could be new a revenue model where tournament creator pay real money for the prize pool, subsidies and to Manifold to run these tournaments\n\nHave a default Manifold tournament that people can opt into that runs every quarter (a month is too short, a year is too long) \n\nFocus on specifically \u201crealized\u201d profits, so people don\u2019t game the system\n\nAlso, have discretion so that people don\u2019t game the system\n\nHave prizes and badges for those who score well in major real-life categories (e.g. economics, sports, tech, AI, Destiny, etc) every quarter. Ideally, the best performer per quarter can be seen on the category leaderboard\n\nHave these prize badges featured on a user's account, so they feel the pride and I can know that they have done well in various categories. A wall of fame wouldn't be a bad idea\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful because I believe it will make Manifold more fun, and help Manifold gain more users and revenue.\n\nThis market resolves to when any of the above changes are made.\n\n==\n\nAppreciation to @GamblingGandalf, @MarcusAbramovitch, and @nickten for their feedback. \n\n[Market creator] PC\n[Creation date] 07-15-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Leagues be the most impactful new feature for Manifold in 2023?\n[Market description] I guess this is also an unofficial announcement of Leagues which will probably start on May 1st! Over the course of the month, you will be able to compete with other users to see who can earn the most mana from actions taken during the season.\n\nAt the end of the year, all people working on Manifold will take a Yes\/No vote. If the majority vote Leagues as the most impactful new feature from 2023 this market will resolve Yes. A split vote resolves no.\n\nSneak peek of leagues here: https:\/\/manifold.markets\/leagues\n\nThis month won't count towards anything, but next month everyone will be reset to 0 and put into groups of 25 similar to those currently existing.\n\nUsers have to earn mana, only counting bets and bonuses made since the start of the season, to move up the ranks. They will also be rewards and other incentives.\n\n If you are interested in seeing our design process for this feature you can see here: https:\/\/manifoldmarkets.notion.site\/Public-Leagues-0cc7640e6f7e40f1bf5f33c923b14f05\n\n \n[Market creator] David Chee\n[Creation date] 04-28-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:    hmm this makes sense to me, now leaning slightly towards manifold love will count as an option in the vote.\n---\n[Date]: 11-01-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Should  manifold.love  count as a \"new feature\" when we are taking a vote?

One goal of leagues is to keep users engaged, which doesn't work so well if you are rewarding past behaviour. It can also make it unfair to go into a new league if someone has tons of markets from previous seasons which are contributing. So we prefer a fresh start. For the record, I don't think incentivising short term markets is necessarily a bad thing. I think some level of forcing people to think of how they can reframe long term questions to resolve more quickly that still helps forecast the end question is a good thing. People don't like predicting on far-off questions and struggle to think in big picture long term probabilities which is often less actionable anyways.\n---\n[Date]: 05-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  they shouldnt, it's on the list of things to do\n---\n[Date]: 05-04-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  we are a startup that is constantly pumping out tons of new features.

Right now the core experience is lacking, with even very long-term active users churning. You place bets on a few interesting things, and then if there is no trending, juicy news people kinda forgot to trade\/don't bother. We hope something like this, in combination with our policy to de-emphasis non-predictive markets (we are going to start unlisting them more actively, and unlisted markets don't count towards leagues), will give people more incentive to be diligent with their trades.\n---\n[Date]: 04-28-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  no.  There are 4 divisions bronze, silver, gold, plat. There will also be diamond next month for ppl who promote.

My final league \"score\" (meaning profits + rewards) was 20,484. This means if you pushed this market all the way down to zero, my final league score would've been 20484 - 7288 = 13196, which would've put me in third place, and with more than twice the score I needed to promote which was 6545 + 1. Am I making some obvious mistake in my reasoning here?\n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  When you say league profits do you mean including bonuses and stuff? I'm assuming you mean the full score incl rewards and stuff, and not just profit. I did not know that would reach 20k at  time of close, but I knew it would reach >12k, which is enough to virtually guarantee promotion.\n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I was only commenting on the profits I got from this market. It increased by 5k before the close. \n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I'm not lying. You are being incoherent. You're using the wrong numbers, and even those wrong numbers support my assertion. Then you call me a liar. 20k is the number I have on the leaderboard, I don't know what to call it, as its a combination of quest rewards, streaks and profit. If this market went to ZERO while I still held all my shares, I would lose 7k, and I'd have 13k on the leaderboard. Anyone can verify this. And this is more than enough to promote, as all I'd need to rank up was 6.5k.\n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  You're not contradicting what I said. I had 20k in the league, even if you subtract those 5k, 15k is more than enough to promote.\n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  \"During the close period both your profits & the profits of people in your leagues changed\" Sorry, but this is simply wrong. You can look at my historical profits, and the historical profits of people in my league, and mine were high enough to safely be in top 5 from before the leagues even entered random mode. The leaderboard was somewhat laggy, and only updated with a delay and at discrete time intervals, maybe that is what is confusing you if you only looked at the leaderboards.\n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Again, no events relevant to the resolution of the market were revealed during the close period. The the resolution of the market regarding the chess match I played against Levina which resulted in more than enough profit to promote, happened 7 hours before the market closed. The temporary close period didn't make any different to anything what so ever, and I choose to reopen it after listening to peoples concerns. I truly do not think I have done anything wrong here, let alone illegal according to manifold's rules.\n---\n[Date]: 06-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Those were fair markets. Playing a high stakes chess game and betting on it is completely fair. Levina thinking love is the most important thing in the universe is fair. I know they believe this IRL. The bets on the group chat is completely fair. The diamond market is completely fair.  You seem to be changing your accusation now, from arguing that THIS market is invalid or illegal or somehow unfair, to just levying whatever personal attacks you can against me, trying to make a more general case that I'm bad or dishonest. \n---\n[Date]: 06-01-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Resolved yes.

But what are the commonly proposed causes? Here's two theories that I've seen discussed a lot:\n\nFeminine essence: Some sort of \"identity essence\" in the brain, such as a neurological body map, can be either male or female, and trans women are males who have been born with a female version of this essence.\n\nBlanchardian: Among gynephilic trans women, the primary cause is autogynephilia, a sexual attraction to being a woman, whereas among androphilic trans women, the cause is unknown, probably similar to the feminine essence but more malleable than the feminine essence model would suggest.\n\nBeyond these two, I also want to introduce three other theories that can be considered plausible:\n\nNeither: Something else, e.g. massive polycausality, explains trans women, and the previously mentioned factors are either epiphenomena or only account for a small fraction of trans women.\n\nFeminine autogynephilia: Similar to the feminine essence theory, there is a part of the brain that is feminized and causes a feminine gender identity. But the important part of the brain is specifically a part of one's sexuality, and the same aspect of sexuality that e.g. autogynephilic cis men have, so the theory doesn't entirely differ from the Blanchardian model either.\n\nJust autogynephilia: Like in the Blanchardian model and unlike in the feminine autogynephilia model, autogynephilia is the major cause of transsexuality among gynephilic trans women. But unlike the Blanchardian model, it is also the major cause of transsexuality among androphilic trans women.\n\nIf a good neurological study is performed that proves one of these theories, then the market will resolve to the corresponding theory. If a very good genetic study or other study proves one of these theories, and people stop investigating it neurologically for some reason, then the market will resolve to the corresponding theory. If no theory gets proven then the market doesn't resolve. If it becomes unresolvable (e.g. all of humanity gets uploaded to computers through some means that doesn't preserve information about how transsexuality works) then the market resolves N\/A.\n\nIf repression or social contagion (ROGD) plays a role, then repression or social contagion will not be counted, and we will instead consider the other factors residual for repression or social contagion.\n\nI won't be trading in this market.\n[Market creator] tailcalled\n[Creation date] 02-26-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-9999\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Review:  https:\/\/surveyanon.wordpress.com\/2023\/07\/08\/first-thoughts-on-elaborating-and-testing-erotic-target-identity-inversion-theory\/\n---\n[Date]: 07-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: New study on a subject adjacent to autogynephilia:  Elaborating and Testing Erotic Target Identity Inversion Theory in Three Paraphilic Samples\n---\n[Date]: 03-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I should note that it will only \"almost certainly\" resolve to feminine essence if the hormonally interference is the  main  factor, not if it is one out of many. Like if there's a normally distributed continuum of biological femininity, and this is one of the contributors to transition, but trans women are only 1 within-sex standard deviation higher than cis men in this continuum, then the market will probably not resolve to feminine essence (but might likely resolve to neither), despite the fact that 1 standard deviation is big compared to the effect sizes you typically see in social science. This is because if it was the sole cause of transition, we'd expect trans women to be like 2-4 standard deviations above average (depending on the estimated transition rate), and if it was a primary-but-not-sole-cause you'd still expect trans women to be pretty close to that. Disclaimer: I may have some of the math wrong here because I'm just going off the top of my head. I'll make sure to post my reasoning for discussion and critique before resolving the market. Though once we know enough to resolve the market, I don't expect we'll need to apply this sort of argument bwcause we understand the mechanisms in more detail.\n---\n[Date]: 03-25-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Depends on how it is caused by the physical environment. If it's something that interferes with masculinization or causes some sort of feminization, then it will almost certainly resolve to feminine essence. However otherwise (e.g. if the physical factor has nothing to do with sex hormones) it might resolve to some other theory.\n---\n[Date]: 03-23-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: There's been some discussion of the resolution criteria in various places, so I should probably write the conclusions here too: I don't think any of the above resolutions are very likely though, just based on statistics and propertues of the things in question. (AFAIK a defining feature of BDD is that changing your body won't help with it, so that seems to contradict it being a trans thing. While transness may be somewhat correlated with autism, I think the correlation is too weak for the market to resolve with autism as a major fact. Also both the unmasculinity and the hypermasculinity theories of autism seem too weak to me. But sure, if the evidence changes then I will change my mind with it.)\n---\n[Date]: 03-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Seems interesting how \"neither\" has 4x more probability than \"feminine essence\" considering the debate is usually between \"feminine essence\" and \"Blanchardianism\".

Which is fair enough; it's a free market. However, I notice that I am confused, because if you announce that you are trying to suppress their probabilities, then other market participants will hear your announcement and learn that the market is biased. And this makes it an obvious target for extracting profit, as they can then in expectation earn mana by bidding up the autogynephilia theories. (This is part of the beauty in prediction markets, that they should - at least in theory - be resistant to manipulation.) Not sure if you didn't realize this dynamic, or didn't actually mean that you were trying to suppress the autogynephilia theories, or are okay with the dynamic anyway, or something else.\n---\n[Date]: 03-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I would be curious if those betting \"neither\" have any thoughts on what the alternatives would be.\n","[Market title] Will I get a girlfriend this year?\n[Market description] Will I get a girlfriend this year? \n\nMy ancap friend thinks there's a 90% chance I get a girlfriend this year if I maintain my current location and level of effort, but I'm a bit more pessemistic.

So I woke up 42 minutes late and resulted in us missing the train with people from the university club to the convention and she wasn\u2019t angry at all. \n1. She pretty much stayed with me at all times at convention, even when she met her other friends.\n1.1 She gave up the opportunity to spend more time with a friend she hadn\u2019t spoken to in 2 years to hang with me.\n2. When I asked her if she wanted to (a) leave at 18:00 to leave with the rest of the club, or (b) leave later and maybe see some mutual acquaintance she said b would be better.\n3. She instinctively referred to us as \u201cwe\u201d on the group chat without clarifying (I had to).\n4. When we were in the train with this other club member, he offered to switch places with me so I could talk to her.\n5. She decided to order at the \u201cfancy\u201d pizza place I went to even though it was a bit \u201cpricey\u201d and her other friend went to a burrito place which I assume was cheaper.\n6. When the mutual acquaintance (who had a place to stay in the convention city) was there and we were leaving, I suggested he drop us off at the train station, and she said he shouldn\u2019t, ostensibly because he\u2019s tired.\n7. She was upset I didn\u2019t attend a club showing because of some homework.\n8. She specifically texted me when I came late to a club showing.\n9. She accepted my dinner invitation (as friends) at short notice, and then we stayed there for three hours. \n9.1 When I said we should leave because the place is closing, she didn\u2019t believe me initially and wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve wanted to go if it weren\u2019t closing.\n10. We were up till 04:30 (arriving at my place at 22:15) playing Lover\u2019s Spacetime and we only stopped because I said I wanted to.\n\nOn average, we have spent 10 hours a week seeing each other in person, and another 10 hours a week texting.\n\nFeb 22, 12:20am: to be clear, this is about romantic liking. This will resolve when either\n0. I ask her out and then her response is yes or no;\n1. the deadline passes, leading to N\/A; or\n2. she starts dating someone else, in which case it is no.\n\nI\u2019m aware there\u2019s a small possibility she could like me, but still says no. Unless I otherwise am informed, the question will resolve to no if she says no.\n\nFeb 22, 1:41am: Good comment from @Jd about negative signals.\nIn terms of negative signals: we're both nerds, and in particular the evidence shows that she doesn't have many other quality friends (she complains about her \"friends\" not really talking and staring at their phones), so maybe she wants to spend more time with me since I actually talk to her. \n\nAnother negative signal is that she almost never initiates, it is almost always me, although whenever I initiate, if it's online she responds instantly most of the time, and for anything in person she's never said no before, and it's always been me ending the hang out sessions.\n\nWe've known each other for more than a year now, but only now really started to hang out (because covid), and before she didn't seem all too interested back then.\n\n\"Le monde moderne, ce sont des id\u00e9es \u00e0 la mode qui passeront comme toutes les modes\"\n\nFeb 22, 13:12: Another possibly negative signal. The club organised a trip to some attraction, but she didn't manage to make the cut-off for reservations. While there we were texting and we had the following exchange (the final response was delayed by several minutes):\n\"how is it?\n\u2014 Alright, kinda miss you.\n\u2014 there there, i'm sure you'll be fine without me\"\nMy message was sent somewhat tactically to see how she feels about me, and her dismissive response could be seen as a \"friend-zone\". But it's also possible she meant it jokingly, or didn't want to respond too strongly as she doesn't know that I like her. Note that we tend to make a lot of jokes, and tend to tease each other frequently.\n\nFeb 23, 1:09pm: Also I encourage anyone to ask questions to better ascertain my chances.\n\nFeb 23, 8:41pm: @Lorenzo In actuality I did ask her, and I do know the answer. But the thing is when I developed the crush, I had recently read about subjective probability, and decided to ask them to tell me what probability they think based on the information I provide and see how it updates overtime, with the messages you\u2019re reading.\n\nRecently I found out about Manifold and decided to post the messages from out chatlog and conversations here to see what people think. I encourage everyone to play honestly, because then it\u2019s more interesting. I\u2019m making sure I don\u2019t ever say anything I know from after I asked her to make sure it\u2019s fair. I also get 50:50 so it\u2019s fair (but mostly because I didn\u2019t realise what it was asking as it was my first time).\n\nIn terms of why I didn\u2019t ask immediately, well I\u2019m an awkward nerd, I needed to work up the courage, to plan how to, and the best moment was 14 days after I developed feelings for her in the real timeline. I also don\u2019t think you should ask out female friends without knowing there\u2019s at least a small possibility (>= 10 %) they might like you, because otherwise due to the unfortunately gendered nature of dating, it means they have a lot of male friends just falling for them \u201cout of the blue\u201d which is unfortunate.\n\nWhoops, \u201cdecided to ask them\u201d should read \u201c decided to ask my friends\u201d.\n\nFeb 25, 12:17pm: (the story will still be in present tense, since the secret is out, I'll post an update every few days so the market has enough time to react but often enough so it's still interesting) \n\nSo I dragged my friends to the club we go to, to see her. When we were walking to the club, I'd mentioned she'd see my friends, and things were a bit awkward. Honestly, things stayed kinda awkward for most of the night, but got better once it was just us again. I also standing\/being closer to her tonight, at the start of the night she would move away, or it seemed like she placed a coat to prevent it, but as it went on she stopped moving away.\n\nMy friends had said based on the information, before they assigned a probability of 30 % that she liked me, but now they assigned 50 %.\n\nAfter my friends were gone, we were talking about the latest club activity which mentioned mental health, and she began talking about one of her friend's mental health problems for like 20 minutes before apologising for basically doxxing them, and saying \"I don't know why I told you all that\". It also turns out she shares one of my incredibly niche interests in something which is incredibly inane for most people which is nice.\n\nFeb 27, 1:14am: I forgot to reply to @Jonathan\u2019s comment, I spent like 20 minutes writing the message, trying very hard to not give it away. You can keep looking for a deeper meaning, but I don\u2019t think most people could discover anything above chance, and I\u2019d urge you to ignore it because it contains post-request information.\n\nFeb 27, 2:57pm: \nSo she left to go back home for the weekend, but she forgot her half-fare card in her room, and she needed it to travel back. I offered to go to her place and mail it back to her. She initially refused because she didn't want to burden me and because her room was a \"complete and utter mess\".\n\nFor the room comment, I pointed out that I'd probably see it messy anyways, which she agreed with, which implies she can see me coming to her place (so far she's only been to my place), and that I don't judge.\n\nIn terms of burdening me, she relented because her mum said (direct quote) \"psychological surveys say doing favours build closer friendships\". Initially I was a bit off-put by this, because it seemed like a bit of a friend-zone, but actually I think this is a good sign if her mum is positive about us being close friends, but I don't really know how much she knows about me.\n\nFor actually getting the half-fare card, she gave me a list of instructions written the way I would (pretty precise and really minute, like enter, turn left, turn right, walk straight etc) and in fact gave me a map of the house to show where her room was.\n\nShe was really thankful I mailed it to her. I noticed an interesting thing, she sent me the photo of the railcard late at night while we were talking, and I said \"I hope you didn\u2019t get up to take the picture \ud83d\ude1d, id prefer if you\u2019d slept lol\", and she mentioned she'd taken the photo yesterday, but \"forgot\" to send it.\nThis is interesting regarding initiation, since she clearly puts effort into making the conversation, but still doesn't initiate very often.\n\nFeb 28, 11:42am: I asked our mutual friend what he thought:\n 0. they have spent 16 h in-person with her.\n1. They thought we were already \u201ca thing\u201d when they met us.\n2. In their discussion with her, they identified what she likes in a guy:\n2.1 \u201cExtroverted but shares some of her interests. Someone who isn\u2019t introverted [a]nd doesn\u2019t spend all the time watching TV or is very awkward\u201d\n3. She told them that she \u201cwasn\u2019t really interested in relationships\u201d\n3.1, They interpret this to mean not that she would reject everyone, but that she isn\u2019t actively seeking anyone, especially because she has some idea of what she\u2019d like in a guy and the fact she wants children.\n4. They approve my plan to ask her out.\n5. They say p is between 50\u201360 %\n5.1 They think the likely outcome is that she will ask me for some time to think about it before saying yes.\n6. Regarding initiation, she doesn\u2019t like to initiate, but she likes to talk to people.\n7. She isn\u2019t the romantic type, so probably wouldn\u2019t be too into hand-holding, hugging etc.\n\nSo 6 confirms what I was thinking, 2.1 is somewhat concerning since I\u2019m not extroverted, but I assume she meant not someone who has low social skills.\n\nI\u2019ll be asking her tomorrow, so get your bets in.\n\nClose date updated to 2022-03-01 12:00 pm\n\nMar 1, 11:57am: So she said no, but she did say when I asked she was only 80 % sure she would say no; ie even she thought it was 20 %. Concerning my %, when the crush started, I thought it was 25 % she liked me, and it later went to 33 % when I asked. Although an interesting trend was people who knew me well would give low %s, like 30 % and later 50 %, whereas people who didn\u2019t would give really high %s like 60-70 % at the start, which seems to be replicated in today\u2019s market (although I did think the market was correcting around feb 23).\n\nI don\u2019t think 79 % is really a realistic %, as the baseline for \u201cdo they like me?\u201d I think would be like 0,1 % by Fermi estimation (assume 100 friends\/acquaintances and people are attracted to someone 10 % of the time), maybe 1 % if people are always attracted to someone. IMO the market really should\u2019ve been at 40 % max. But thanks for believing in me \ud83d\ude0a , and for taking part in this experiment.\n[Market creator] Sam\n[Creation date] 02-22-2022\n[Closing data] 03-01-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"17":["[Market title] Will Qorantos Grow As a Streamer this year?\n[Market description] Will Qorantos Grow As a Streamer?

I edited the original comment to correct my mistake.\n---\n[Date]: 05-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I made some visualizations of this market. Note that I only calculated the values at the times when trades were made, so the values of the averages, etc., at times between trades are not exact, they are just being linearly interpolated by Matplotlib. First, here is the graph of the average percentage over the whole time the market was open: It's hard to see most of it because of that spike at the beginning, so here's what it looks like with the beginning cut off: The final average was 49.99904%. The graph makes it look like it went above 50% at the very end, but actually that's showing what happened about 4 minutes before the end, where the average briefly flipped above 50%, only to go back down. Now, here's a graph of the average that would have been required to flip the Tekram at each point in time (That is, at time t, what would the average over all future times have to be for the final average to be exactly 50%?): Unsurprisiningly, it's pretty much just 50% for most of the time, though here's a zoomed in version of those earlier times: The final result wasn't determined until about 10 seconds before close. The final result for the unrounded average was determined earlier, about 21 minutes from close. But the results were opposites of each other. The rounded average crossed 50% ten different times, while the unrounded average crossed 50% five times.\n---\n[Date]: 04-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I didn't do the harmonic mean because the harmonic mean of [0,1] is 0, so it would be impossible for Team NO to win if I used the same method for determining the threshold they have to beat as I did in the other markets.

Front-page April Fools Day feature! M$2 million volume! Lots of lag! The biggest spike in Manifold revenue  ever ! (Seriously, check out the revenue graph on  manifold.markets\/stats .) King (Isaac) has become king (of the all-time Manifold profit leaderboard). Traunches have been laid down, and whales and common bettors alike have won and lost. In Which The Creator, Who Got Filthy Rich On Bettor Bonuses, Laments His Market I have mixed feelings about my biggest market ever being a self-resolving market (as I keep finding myself saying, bet on gambles and your profits are in shambles), and I plan to keep most of my markets about real events, political, personal, and everything in between. Nevertheless, many people seem to have found this fun, and that makes me happy! Just always remember never to bet mana you'd feel rotten losing. Also remember that it's just a fake-money betting platform. (Unless you're   and you've lost thousands of dollars worth of mana, in which case...well, he said he was trying to make an indirect charitable donation, and it seems like a lot of NO bettors are donating to charity, so...) If anyone feels a desire to quit Manifold over their losses, I'd love to talk you out of it. (So would  , according to her comments.) Honestly, I'm surprised by how many free-mana opportunities there still are, if you know where to look. The other day I made M$903 by simply checking whether the resolution criteria of  a market  had been met and finding that it had been for  two months . And if you bet on real markets, you're improving the accuracy of my favorite website ever for finding probabilities of real-world events. I hope you help contribute to the Manifold project! Certainly I'd love it if you bet on  some of my (obscurer) markets . Back to The Market As for The Market: Official calculations are still being vetted, but it seems like the final average percentage ended up around 36 or 37%. The rounding was weird but seems to have made almost no difference. Hopefully a consensus will emerge about what the correct answer is, but not quite yet \u2014 see  this market . The latest data still has to be added to  's  spreadsheet , but it's been a great resource. It seems like a NO victory became foreordained about 24 hours before the market closed, and that the geometric mean (lol) ended up at 0, since The Market briefly hit 0.0%.

An identical one for 2016 would have resolved identically, except for Clallam.\n\nIf any counties flip between 2020 and 2024, they will probably be among those with the most narrow 2020 margins (less than 10 percentage points in either direction):\n\nSkagit (D+7.5)\n\nClark (D+5.1)\n\nClallam (D+3.4)\n\nPacific (R+1.1)\n\nMason (R+3.9)\n\nSpokane (R+4.3)\n\nGrays Harbor (R+6.6)\n\nYakima (R+7.7)\n\nChelan (R+7.8)\n\nWalla Walla (R+8.7)\n\nKlickitat (R+9.4)\n\nSkamania (R+9.5)\n\nThis market closes when polls close in Washington on Election Day. To prevent misresolution, this question does not fully resolve until the presidential election in every county in Washington has been officially called by the Associated Press. Depending on various factors, this question might resolve the night it closes; or it might not resolve until a week or more later. In the event that the Associated Press refuses to or is unable to call a particular county, I will wait until official, finalized results are available from the Washington Secretary of State's office before I resolve this market - hopefully, that doesn't happen, but if it does, this market may not resolve until December.\n\nIf the Democratic Party, United States, or Washington stop existing before November 2024; or if the 2024 U.S. presidential election never occurs: this market resolves as N\/A.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 06-26-2023\n[Closing data] 10-10-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"22":["[Market title] Who will win the 2023 UCI Road World Championships Elite Men's Road Race?\n[Market description] The race is on 6 August 2023\n[Market creator] Eliza\n[Creation date] 04-06-2023\n[Closing data] 08-06-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-01-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Related market, fixed instead of parimutuel:\n---\n[Date]: 07-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Related market for the womens race, which is bound to be extremely exciting:\n---\n[Date]: 07-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Also, if we get 5-8 favorites above the baseline within the next few days, I will also make a fixed multiple choice market for this race.\n---\n[Date]: 07-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: One of the primary considerations when thinking about how a Worlds race will go needs to be team composition and motives.  In this case, the course does not guarantee a bunch sprint and it does not guarantee a small group will go to the finish -- so there are a lot of potential ways the race can play out. The top 5 riders listed so far (Remco, Wout, Mathieu, Jasper, Tadej) have confounding factors that make picking them somewhat tricky! Belgium  (Remco, Wout, Jasper) brings a very strong team that should be able to manage the race even if other squads all look at them to do so. But the personal relationship between Remco, Wout, and Jasper seems very tricky to manage -- does the team need to give Wout a free role in the final even if Jasper is still in the group? Will Wout lead out Jasper? Will Wout cover attacks if Remco is up the road? This feels tricky to navigate.  However, if Remco cannot get away in his own move, I do think he would be an excellent teammate in the late stages of a race bound for a sprint finish. Netherlands  (Mathieu) also suffer from a \"too many leaders\" issue in a slightly different way than Belgium does.  If the race truly comes to a bunch sprint finish, is MVDP going to lead out Kooij? Or will MVDP have completely toasted himself attacking before that.  What if Van Baarle and MVDP are both in a late race leading pack and can't decide which one should make the next attack? And then the rest of the squad is still capable, but probably not as capable as Belgium's. Slovenia  (Tadej) has not (that I can find) announced their full team yet, but one of their strongest competitors Mohoric has announced he will not be going to the race.  Pogacar can absolutely be in the lead group at this race no matter how it plays out, but if he misses the right move, he might lack a team that can pull it back to put him in position. --- Overall, I think the favorites so far are good, but there are a LOT of other people out there with their own chances.  If Belgium announces before the race that they are 100% committed to Jasper and no other plans, they would probably be the absolute favorites. That just seems unlikely though, because the teammates Wout and Remco likely also sense a race that they should be able to win.\n","[Market title] How many different riders will wear the yellow jersey in the 2023 Tour de France?\n[Market description] The yellow jersey is worn by the rider who leads the general classification (GC) standings after the last completed stage. If a rider moves into the lead of the GC but fails to start the next stage, they will still be considered to have 'worn the yellow jersey'. In such a case, the rider who takes over as GC leader in their absence will only be counted as a yellow jersey wearer if they actually wear the jersey.\n\nExample: Remco Evenepoel withdrew from this year's Giro d'Italia before stage 10 while leading the GC standings. Geraint Thomas was in 2nd place before Evenepoel's withdrawal. Even if Thomas had not been GC leader after stage 10, he would still be considered to have worn the leader's jersey since he decided to wear it on stage 10 itself.\n\nFurthermore, if the jersey changes hands on the final stage, the rider leading the GC standings after the stage will be considered a yellow jersey wearer.\n\nThe market will close on the first rest day, 10 July.\n[Market creator] Eoghan\n[Creation date] 05-31-2023\n[Closing data] 07-10-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-31-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  As an aside, the yellow jersey changing hands on the Champs Elysees would mean we'd be in for a very exciting Tour!\n---\n[Date]: 05-31-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Good question.

In the absence of something like that there is going to still be a chance of Yes up to likely a week before.  I'm curious to see if he shows up at the National Championships for a potential meeting with Pogacar. Before the Giro my assumption was there was a significant chance he would either not start or not finish the Giro due to injury, illness, crash, whatever. If any of those roadblocks happened, he would have been much more likely to start the Tour. But now that the Giro has finished and nothing happened, I was really expecting this to shift from 25-30% range down to the 10-15% range quickly. So far it didn't happen yet but it seems the Yes side are very enthusiastic still. My overall position is around 22% and I'm still happy with that -- Jumbo Visma wants to win the Tour and Roglic is the very best rider\/helper that any team could add to their squads.

But they were not alone, for there were others in the fray, secret market participants, unknown, and operating in the gray. These participants made secret deals, exchanging insider tips, manipulating the market to their advantage with cunning dips. Levi and Levina knew of their existence, but could not tell who they were or what they did, but their actions cast a spell. Their bets and investments seemed to come out of nowhere, leading Levi and Levina to suspect that there was something to beware. But when it came to the resolution of each bet, they both relied on cryptography, blockchain, and advanced technology to decide. The blockchain's transparency revealed the secrets that they kept, exposing the unknown participants and their manipulative steps. And it was then that they discovered the secret relations to other markets, connections that spanned the globe, and other prediction markets. Levi and Levina knew that the prediction market game was not just their own, that there were others out there, playing the game, and with their own throne. But they were undeterred, for they knew that the blockchain's power and might, could keep the market transparent, secure, and fair, day and night. In the end, whether Levi or Levina emerged victorious, the blockchain's power ensured that the bets were secure and glorious. And the prediction market game continued, with its twists and turns, knowing that the blockchain was there, to ensure that fairness and security always burned.\n---\n[Date]: 05-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: As always, up for deals.

Every year, the Effective Altruism community coordinates around posting videos for charities chosen ahead of time. From https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/aGLiq389hAzC2g6KA\/project-for-awesome-2021-was-a-success-1, the historical amounts won by EA charities is: * 2021: Likely total of $189,700. ~$27,000 for The Against Malaria Foundation, The Good Food Institute, GiveDirectly, Clean Air Task Force, The Humane League, Givewell Maximum Impact Fund, and Wild Animal Initiative. * 2020: No P4A this year - it was moved from December 2020 to February 2021. * 2019: Total of $58,804.40. At least $14,701.10 for The Against Malaria Foundation, The Good Food Institute, GiveDirectly, and Clean Air Task Force. * 2018: Total of $55,891.44. $18,630.48 for The Against Malaria Foundation, The Good Food Institute, and GiveDirectly. * 2017: Total of $39,436. $19,718 for The Against Malaria Foundation and GiveDirectly. * 2016: Total of $50,000. $25,000 for The Against Malaria Foundation and The Good Food Institute. * 2015: $25,000 for The Against Malaria Foundation. This will resolve YES if the total amount given to EA charities according to http:\/\/www.fightworldsuck.org\/previous-grants\/ when results for 2022 are available is greater than or equal to $50,000.

And for most of my life, this has been a one-way relationship filled with disappointment and heartache. Sure, we\u2019ll always have Nick Foles and the \u201cPhilly Special\u201d at Super Bowl 52 (though my favorite memory from that game isn\u2019t Foles catching a pass; it\u2019s then-Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dropping one). But this is a franchise with an all-time loss record of .490 as of the end of 2021, one tick lower than the Cleveland Browns. The Browns!\n\nThis year has been different, though. With a 13-2 record as of the last week of December, my Eagles sit at the top of the NFL. We have an exciting young quarterback in Jalen Hurts, a trio of elite wide receivers who all for some reason have Batman-related nicknames, and a left offensive tackle approximately the size of two Jason Momoas. At of December 27, the sportsbooks at Fanduel put the odds of an Eagles win in Super Bowl LVII at 16.9 percent. That\u2019s just behind the Kansas City Chiefs at about 18.2 percent and the Buffalo Bills at 22.2 percent, but I\u2019m going to give the Eagles a boost on the basis of my \u201cnothing good happens to Buffalo\u201d theory, which historically has been very accurate, and because Philadelphia fans are familiar with Chiefs coach Andy Reid\u2019s inability to read a game clock. And should the Eagles fail, I can offer a prediction with 100 percent certainty: We will boo them. \u2014BW\n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 02-13-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"29":["[Market title] [planecrash] jvyy xrygunz oernx uvf pyrevp obaq jvgu nonqne orsber gur raq bs gur \"pevfvf bs snvgu\" guernq?\n[Market description] \n[Market creator] Jade Rustle\n[Creation date] 06-07-2022\n[Closing data] 06-16-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Zal het OM voor 2024 proberen FvD te verbieden?\n[Market description] Deze markt wordt met ja afgesloten als het OM een zaak begint en de strafeis van het OM een verbod of ontbinding van FvD omvat. \n\nOct 24, 9:36pm: Zal het OM voor 2024 proberen de FvD te verbieden? \u2192 Zal het OM voor 2024 proberen FvD te verbieden?\n[Market creator] Wie Dan\n[Creation date] 10-24-2022\n[Closing data] 12-31-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Meta discontinue development of Threads by Jan 1 2025?\n[Market description] I will resolve it YES if it is deleted from iOS and Android app stores (updated from: I will resolve YES if major tech publications will announce that)\n[Market creator] Pawel\n[Creation date] 07-11-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-06-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: X rebranding may be bad IMO. @peterthiel thinks that brand is one of the foundation of a company (he says ~\u201cI don\u2019t understand quite how this works\u201d).

I went to bed and woke up this morning, and the first thing I did was start the Free-Response questions (so no studying in between, but there was a difference in mental ability as well as just a time gap). I did much better on these and was able to get a 5 (somewhat narrowly). I graded myself somewhat harshly in my opinion but there were definitely things that could've been harsher. Today I start Stats!\n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Update: Just to reiterate- I'm taking CS A, Stats, and Calc. CS A is next Wednesday, and I plan to do most of my studying for this test from now until Friday. I have a book that I'm going through and I think it's pretty good. Everything seems to be pretty easy and even the practice tests that I've glanced at seem to be okay. I have enough resources for this (I think) and I should be able to finish the book by Friday. I then plan to take a practice test or two before the test (I'll take at least one for sure) and review accordingly. I expect to score a 5 if all goes to plan. Stats is next Thursday. I've taken a class on Stats this entire year, and according to my teacher, we have two units left: chi-squares and slopes. I asked my teacher and they said that a lot of the material we've gone over isn't the \"mindset\" of the AP tests and one should take at minimum three practice tests before then. I'm basically spending the entire weekend studying for Stats, and will also take a practice test- probably on Monday or Tuesday. I would like to take at least two tests as this would be better for me. I have no clue how to use the calculator for stats (I'm working on that) and my current resources are a book and Khan Academy. I plan to primarily use the book, but I expect I'll use Khan Academy at some point. The book has enough practice tests for me to take. I expect to get at least a 3, and depending on how much I can get done, I think it's possible for me to get a 4. Calc is in two Wednesdays. I took calc last year and since have forgotten quite a lot. I plan to study for Calc after next Thursday, so I'll hopefully have a few days to do so. I think the AP I have to study the most for is Calc, but I've reviewed most of the concepts that I forgot entirely and so I have higher hopes for this one than for Stats. I am using Khan Academy (I didn't mention it before but it's a wonderful resource) but unfortunately, I lost my Calc book somewhere in my house and cannot find it. In the event that I do not find it sometime soon, I will have to blindly go into the exam without having taken a good practice test. I have old packets of practice tests from years past and can find some online but the grading and platform are suboptimal.

(i.e., the non-profit entity associated with the Future Fund) receive a demand to give the money back (e.g., to be distributed among FTX bankruptcy creditors)?\n[Market description] As almost all of you have likely heard, FTX, FTX US, and Alameda will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. \n\nThe FTX Future Fund gave away grants to many recipients.\n\nThe question is, by 2028, will at least 50% of U.S. based distinct entities that received those grants via the FTX Foundation, Inc. (received within the past 90 days of the date of bankruptcy filing) have their money attempted to be \"clawed back\" - in the sense that they are told (e.g., by a court order or letter from the FTX entities or letter from creditors) that they have to give back the money (e.g., to be redistributed among bankruptcy creditors)?  \n\nThis is NOT an estimate of whether such projects would be forced to give the money back if they were to defend themselves in court, only whether they will receive such a demand (e.g., via a letter from the FTX entities).\n\nSome relevant links:\n\nhttps:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/o8B9kCkwteSqZg9zc\/thoughts-on-legal-concerns-surrounding-the-ftx-situation\n\n\"Essentially, if you received money from an FTX entity in the debtor group anytime on or after approximately August 11, 2022, the bankruptcy process will probably ask you, at some point, to pay all or part of that money back\"\n\nAnd:\n\n'[L]egal experts argue that even if these funds were proven to be linked to wrongdoing, there probably would be no legal basis for clawbacks. James Cox, professor of corporate and securities law at Duke University, said this was due to the \u201cbona fide\u201d principle, which protects individuals who accept money with no knowledge it derives from illicit activity.' https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/428c7800-c72d-4c59-9940-4376fea6e263 (paywalled) (this is about political donations though, so may not be relevant).\n\nAnd here is more info about this entity \"FTX Foundation, Inc\" and what connection it may or may not have to the other FTX entities:\n\nWhile payments for different grants from the Future Fund came from different entities, there was one entity, in particular, that seems to have made quite a number of \u00a0grants:\n\nFTX Foundation, Inc.\n\nI see no mention of this entity in the Alameda bankruptcy documents: (https:\/\/s.wsj.net\/public\/resources\/documents\/alameda-filing-11112022.pdf)\n\nWhat's more, this diagram that has been floating around of their corporate structure (https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sUb2efI.png) shows FTX Foundation Inc. (at the bottom of the chart) as being unconnected to the other entities.\n\nThe FTX Foundation Inc. seems to have Delaware file number \u00a06586501, which, when I search for it in the Delaware corporate database (https:\/\/icis.corp.delaware.gov\/eCorp\/EntitySearch\/NameSearch.aspx) with a different name - \u00a0FTX PHILANTHROPY, INC. - but this entity is also not in the bankruptcy filing from what I can tell, and I think not on the corporate structure chart mentioned above either.\n\nSo, what is \u00a0FTX Foundation Inc.? Here (https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/2mx6xrDrwiEKzfgks\/announcing-the-future-fund-1?commentId=qtJ7KviYxWiZPubtY), one of the people running the Future Fund says:\n\n\"We have a number of entities we can use to provide funding, and which we use depends on the exact circumstances.

A friend doing HFT told me it's a common practice for exchanges to have dedicated IPs for traders with large volumes, and if anyone can satisfy the criteria and get a dedicated IP to place orders without Cloudflare, and there are companies who did that, this should resolve to No. If no one except for Alameda was able to place orders without Cloudflare, it's likely I'll resolve this to Yes, pending someone clarifying the whole what \"priority in trade execution\" means\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  well, that doesn\u2019t update me at all.

Is \"priority\" referring just to the execution mechanism, once the trades are placed, or does it include the time it takes to place the trades? IIRC, Alameda could use the API without CloudFlare in between, which meant it could place trades faster. I think this happens on traditional exchanges as well- trading firms try to get as little delay as possible, including making agreements and placing servers next to the exchange, but while they place trades faster, there's no priority in trade execution. Not sure if it's also the case here- I guess the FTX engine could've prioritised Alameda's trades.

Also, I am not familiar with how these bureaucracies work, but things always seem to come together last minute, like a chess game where someone finally takes a piece and triggers a series of exchanges in rapid sucession. It would not surprise me if SpaceX hasn't officially submitted a report, but they've shared a draft, and the FAA haven't officially given the list of corrective actions, but they've shared an indicative list, and basically SpaceX will implement the corrective actions, and then all the drafts will become final documents and be submitted and responded to in quick sucession. I don't know if that's how it works, but it seems like it sometimes.

If we liked we could set a threshold for \"near orbital\" like that it has to reach 95% of the speed required for a 160km circular orbit, or something like that. Where as you said it's the plan that counts, not the outcome. I think the target trajectory will probably put Starship somewhere between 99.5% and 100% of the speed that would be needed for a 160km circular orbit (though it won't be a circular orbit), so it's getting so close that whether it reaches orbital speed will depend on exactly what you consider to be the lowest realistic orbit (I've picked 160km for the below question, but 150km is also a defensible choice)\n"],"34":["[Market title] Conditional on SBF being convicted of a felony, how long will his jail sentence be?\n[Market description] The length of Sam Bankman-Fried's jail sentence, whether SBF pleads guilty, is found guilty, or is tried in absentia (in the United States).

SBF agrees to extradition to the United States, giving up the opportunity to spend years fighting extradition. The cooperation of two lieutenants with detailed insider knowledge and the rapid extradition to the USA mean that the probability of a conviction before 2026 is very, very high.  The lieutenants can corroborate each other's testimony. Any part of the fraud that was not documented electronically (sometimes on a cryptographically-signed immutable public ledger!) might be explained when Wang and Ellison are cross-examined.  I think the Southern District of New York is playing a very strong hand here. When SDNY tells other FTX executives to come forth and cooperate now, I don't think it's a bluff.  Things are moving fast. Just piled my last M into YES. Any price less than 98% is silly at this point.

FYI, you can check the current price based on the order book: it's just the average of the highest bid and lowest ask (i.e. the mid price).

(I think there's a small but non-negligible chance that the decimals will make a difference, but regardless, it's better to clarify sooner rather than later.) To explain the rationale, first some context: The price graph shows the order book midprice. By default it is rounded (e.g. 4.5 rounds to 5). With the decimals setting, it shows the exact price. (This is all to the best of our knowledge, if there are any inaccuracies please let me know, but it won't change the current decision.) The rationale is that the true underlying price is the exact one, not the rounded one. And given that there is a display option that allows you to show the exact price instead of the rounded price, it makes more sense to resolve based on the exact price. The main counterargument is that this would be using a non-default setting for the displayed price graph. However, on balance using the non-rounded price seems more in line with both the spirit and the letter of the question. It's also worth noting, the exact prices of YES and NO do appear to always add up to 100%. They only were off because of rounding, as mentioned above. So using the exact price means that YES and NO prices are symmetric, whereas if we used the rounded prices there could be a situation where YES shows 5% while NO shows 96% - we already decided that this question would resolve only on the YES price, but it's nice that with the exact prices they are actually symmetric and there's no difference between YES<5 and NO>95.\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Thanks! In that case, this also explains why we noticed that YES and NO didn't add up to 100% - what was happening was that if the midpoint of the order book was YES = 5.5% and NO = 94.5%, it would round both up to show YES = 6% and NO = 95%, unless you turned the decimal options on. (The fact that it didn't add up to 100% was why I thought it must be something other than the order book midpoint, now that I know it's rounded it all makes sense.)\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 0\n[Text]: I'll also note, the Polymarket trades on this market are at integer prices. So I actually don't know exactly what the price graph means and why it sometimes shows e.g. 5.5% if you enable the decimals option. If anyone knows, please let me know!\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 6\n[Text]: That's a nice idea in theory but when you break it down you realize it's full of problems. For one, what does \"actual %\" mean? This is clear on Manifold but on most other markets (polymarket, stock markets, etc) it can be quite ambiguous! Another issue is, how do you make sure the historical data for that is available and easy to check? This is why I specifically set the resolution criteria for this question based on the price graph - because that way everyone is looking at the same data and there is a clear historical record of the data. (I did not realize Polymarket had options that changed the graph display, otherwise I would have of course specified whether the options would or would not be used.) There are other ways this market could have been specified - for example, based on the raw transaction prices - but there are significant disadvantages to that, such as the fact that it's harder for everyone to check that data - it's there but it's not immediately readable the way the graph is.\n---\n[Date]: 08-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Thanks for pointing out the decimals setting.

(I did not vote, but I agree with this as well.) The reasoning is that when one talks about the price of a yes\/no market, it is generally understood that this refers to the price of yes shares. They generally did not believe this strongly, but thought it was a better fit than other interpretations.

I will base my opinion on the consensus of expert condensed matter researchers. \n\n[link preview]Edit 2022-08-01 15:23:00 EST:\n\nTo clarify further, the \"Some type of superconductor, but not at room temperature with near-ambient pressure.\" is NOT going to be the winner. It is not mutually exclusive with the other options, degrading the market. You can sell it down to zero for free Mana. Do NOT buy that option.\n\nIf the Meissner effect videos were taken with the material super-cooled, and the material is otherwise uninteresting I will rule as \"a complete fabrication\". If the videos were taken super-cooled. and the material is a powerful diamagnet at room temp, I will resolve diamagnet. \n\nEDIT 2022-08-01 15:37 EST:\n\nMy goal is for the top choices at the end to be mutually exclusive and reasonably comprehensive. To that end, I may introduce new choices that are more descriptive and mutually exclusive and\/or choose to NOT resolve in favor of existing choices. For example, if someone points out (hypothetically) that Type I and Type III SC's are not mutually exclusive or something, I may create a new option that rescues mutual exclusivity and choose NOT to pick either of those options. In addition, if there is a new option that comes to light in peer review, I am likely to make an option for it -- rather than letting the market simply resolve as \"Other\".\n\nEDIT 2022-08-08 00:04:00 EST\n\nConsider the three types of magnetism as a set S = {diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism}. The lack of a specific member of set S in an answer choice is understood to mean its absence in LK-99. I will also resolve the question in favor of the most specific descriptor. For example, if LK-99 is found to be ferromagnetic and powerfully diamagnetic, I will resolve in favor of the answer choice that has both of these. If the amount of a certain kind of magnetism is de minimis (ie non-exotic, commonly found in other materials), I may ignore it. For example, if LK-99 is only very slightly paramagnetic, I may choose to ignore that aspect of it in determining the answer.\n\nEDIT 2022-08-29 19:30:00 EST\n\nThis paper suggests to me that LK-99 is in the normal range of diamagnetism for an insulator, but shows an interesting amount of ferromagnetism (which would be an important component in explaining the partial levitation). The research was done to a high standard and the purity is unsurpassed per XRD, so this is pretty strong evidence (albeit not conclusive). I'm unlikely to resolve this market until we see peer reviewed papers. \n\nhttps:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2308.06256.pdf\n\nNotably, if we see superconductivity when synthesized as a thin film, I will likely resolve in favor of one of the superconducitivity choices -- even if the bulk material is conclusively shown to not be superconducting.\n[Market creator] aashiq\n[Creation date] 08-01-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-18-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Note, I am NOT going to delay resolution of this market.

Wherever you see \"diamagnetic\" in the choices, you can mentally substitute \"powerfully diamagnetic\". My goal there is just to avoid resolving the question based on technicalities, such as a miniscule amount of diamagnetism. I have no idea about the ferromagnetism! XRD and EPS seems like a good way of defining LK-99. However, it would be a bit sad if LK-99 is actually the wrong material or something, and LKK have some slightly different material that superconducts as a thin film with a different structure. For example, I have seen speculation that doing the synthesis in an oxygen-rich atmosphere would change the composition for the better.

LK-99 is described as anisotropic in the OG papers. If true, the superconducting properties should depend on the internal structure being homogeneous AND the orientation of the sample being correct with respect to the applied current. The measurements in the OG papers were done on a thin film of LK-99.  Why doesn't the sample levitate fully and exhibit flux pinning?  It is a 1-D superconductor. See below. Magnetism exerts torque that rotates the sample until the flux that is normal to the sample is at equilibrium with gravity. https:\/\/twitter.com\/iris_IGB\/status\/1686402135687151618?s=20 Why do replication attempts show high resistivity?  They were performed on bulk samples with impurities and\/or bad orientations. The original paper synthesized a thin film to test this, which afaik replication attempts have not done. Why do replication attempts exhibit the Meissner effect if they are so impure?  The magnetic fields permeate the impurities and are expelled from the superconducting region.  Why isn't this just diamagnetism?  The strength of observed diamagnetism would be ridiculously huge relative to known diamagnets. Lead is super heavy.  Could this be a fabrication?  Sure, I still see only few replications. What about the simulation?  Lots of things show properties from the simulation. None of them are room temp SC's.  Why not a type I superconductor?  theorized to be only possible at low T Why not a type III one?  Newish physics, not well known.

If anything here differs from the 2023-07-27 update, this update should supersede that one. I believe what I have written below maintains the spirit of the market and preserves its predictivity against weird edge cases. \n\nMaterials Impurities:\n\nThis question is specifically about LK-99. In the absence of overwhelming expert consensus (see below about resolution caveats), adding materials not in the original synthesis or characterization (replacing Cu with Au, Ag, etc) will not count toward a YES resolution.\u00a0\n\nRemoving impurities (like CuS) is OK.\n\nIncreasing impurities that were also present in LK-99 original XRD is OK, up to a point. I think I would be more accepting of this is it\u2019s convincingly shown that the impurities are important to the superconductivity of LK-99.\u00a0\n\nSynthesis of LK-99 by other means is totally fine, as long as the material characterization satisfies the criteria above.\u00a0\n\nSuperconductivity:\n\nThe original intent of this market was to bet on whether LK-99 exhibited the hallmarks of traditional superconductivity, but there have been a few questions on what happens if LK-99 is regions of 1D superconductivity in an insulating matrix, so it doesn\u2019t display the expected R = 0 behavior below Tc.\u00a0\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m going to hew to the original resolution criteria, in order of importance.\u00a0\n\nDemonstration of:\n\nMeissner effect\n\nR = 0 below Tc (satisfied by electric field < 0.1 - 1 uV\/cm or resistivity < ~10^-11 Ohm*cm)\n\nPhase change\n\nWhile superconductor-insulator transitions have been observed, I\u2019m not really familiar with them. Additionally, we don\u2019t have good evidence that it is impossible to observe R=0 in LK-99, since at least some measurements show decreasing resistivity as a function of temperature. If we end up in a world where LK-99 convincingly displays a Meissner effect, but doesn\u2019t show the expected resistivity behavior, I will solicit opinions from subject matter experts. After all, it would seem perverse to resolve NO if the majority of superconductivity experts think this is a YES.\n\nResolution Caveats:\n\nI reserve the right to resolve to a probability if the experts I ask are split on the question of superconductivity.\n\nI reserve the right to resolve according to whatever Wikipedia says about this material by Jan 1, 2025, especially if the experts I ask blow me off.\n\nI reserve the right to revisit the resolution criteria if LK-99 or LK-99-like materials end up rewriting what we thought we knew about superconductivity.\u00a0\n\n********************************************\n\nUpdate 2023-07-27:\n\nPasting my comment on resolution criteria\n\nWe're clearly all here because a) it's fun, and b) we're interested in room temperature superconductivity, not whether some other experimental group gets the same kinda sus data as the original paper. So, when I write 'replicate' in the question I am specifically asking: is the room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity of the compound LK-99 convincingly demonstrated?\n\nSpecifically, replications should convincingly demonstrate:\n\nZero DC electrical resistivity (or something close enough if the measurement is AC). \n\nA phase change*, which is usually exhibited as a sharp discontinuity in the heat capacity. \n\nThe Meissner effect (magnetic fields expelled).\n\nIf synthesizing the compound, there should be evidence that they did make something essentially the same as what is reported in the original paper. \n\n2) has an asterisk because @BenjaminShindel suggests that a phase change might not be required for a quantum well superconductor. I think I see how this could be the case. Willing to adjust this criterion after receiving more info from relevant theorists\/experimentalists. \n\nI don't intend to require that replications be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The arXiv is sufficient for me. However, I do intend to wait a few weeks\/months to resolve so that any pre-print can be adequately investigated for data manipulation, fraud, etc. In my utopia, labs that claim to have confirmed\/disconfirmed this effect would also publish their raw data with their arXiv submissions, but I'm not holding my breath. \n\nSince high Tc superconductivity is not my specific field of expertise, I'm willing to defer to a consensus of subject matter experts on whether a pre-print is convincing or not, and I am willing to contact some beyond the usual twitter personalities.\n\n\n[Market creator] Quantum Observer\n[Creation date] 07-25-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2025\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-19-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Probably this https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2312.10391\n---\n[Date]: 12-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   https:\/\/x.com\/quantumwitness\/status\/1736999645400715557?s=46 I can\u2019t tell whether this paper is retracted or just fucked up.

Cures are very, very rare. People signficiantly overestimate the number of illnesses that can be cured through an FDA approved treatment. The bar is also high on this market due to the fact 1M people must be afflicted for the cure to resolve the market. Surgery, unlike non-invasive medicine, often cures a condition (e.g. any organ transplant), and there are surgical robots. That said, the FDA doesn't have oversight over surgical procedures. Now, if an autonomous surgical robot had a program to perform a surgery autonomously, would the FDA step in to regulate that? A high potential area where cures may occur in this decade is in oncology. Cancer isn't effectively treated without curing it. It's also a space that's regulated by the FDA. There has been some recent success in base editing, and it's likely that AI would be needed for the process of generating the personalized cure. With antibiotic resistance on the rise, another promising area would be an FDA approved macrophage based treatment that selects a macrophage to treat infections using an AI pairing tool. Right now it's a manual process and is slow and doesn't scale well - but imagine every hospital with a room full of macrophages ready to be deployed based on a test result. I'm not in medicine so I don't understand the barriers to general availability here, but it's a possibility. While cures are rare, we're still at the beginning of the bathtub curve of what AI can do.

If they have an illness, even without symptoms, and it significantly shortens lifespan, and the treatment resolves the issue permanently (for >50% of people treated) then it counts. If the treatment must continue for life, even if the vaccine aspect is permanent, then it wouldn't count.\n","[Market title] [Convince Me] Aspartame (the molecule) is in any way harmful to human health [bet down to 1%, 500 lim]\n[Market description] From wikipedia\n\nAspartame is rapidly hydrolyzed in the small intestine by digestive enzymes which break aspartame down into methanol, phenylalanine, aspartic acid\n\nPhenylalanine and aspartice acid are amino acids and methanol is produced in smaller amounts than naturally present in the body \/ are produced by metabolism of common foods such as fruits. I'm absurdly confident that aspartame isn't harmful.\n\nNevertheless, this was retweeted by twitter-jack, which claims\n\nScientists, on the basis of early testing, were saying aspartame was a carcinogen in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but Donald Rumsfeld, who was CEO of the company that owned Aspartame, became part of the Reagan transition team and got to appoint the new head of the FDA, who then went on to cast the deciding vote in favour of allowing Aspartame into the American food supply\n\nI am not including potential 'taste-based diet change' effects here - if the sweet taste that doesn't correspond to sugar intake causes some homeostasis on sugar intake to be knocked slightly off or something, that doesn't count. That is, imo, a marginal reason to not consume aspartame if you aren't already overweight!\n\nIn case anyone tries to rules lawyer, I mean 'significantly out of distribution in health harms of normal healthy foods' - after all 'All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.'\n\nedit: resolves PROB to confidence\n\nMORE CLARIFICATIONS:\n\nAspartame is harmful to people with the inborn disorder of metabolism PKU. However those with PKU also have to avoid a wide variety of normal healthy foods, so I do not consider that to qualify.\n\n-- offtopic --\n\nThe guy jack retweeted seems to be a bit racist.\n\nThe tweet also claims propionic acid is bad, which I also think is wrong, considering \"Propionic acid is produced biologically as its coenzyme A ester, propionyl-CoA, from the metabolic breakdown of fatty acids containing odd numbers of carbon atoms, and also from the breakdown of some amino acids.\"\n[Market creator] jackson polack\n[Creation date] 07-02-2023\n[Closing data] 07-10-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: okay, i'll try to get the full text\n---\n[Date]: 07-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Multiple opposing heuristics can exist and one can be stronger than another. Aspartame may taste weird, but, when metabolized, it's broken down into three molecules that already exist in the body in larger concentrations in normal situations. The latter reason seems stronger than the former reason. You could argue the bad taste is related (via not being available to our ancestors during natural selection) to the fact aspartame has no nutritional value, and it might in fact harm you by confusing the way you use taste to evaluate what food to eat, or something.

I bounced off the last paragraph about 'similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs', but it seems to contradict itself about whether aspartame is anti inflammatory?

Roughly, they measured sucrose vs sweeteners on CRP, transferrin, and haptoglobin. More CRP and haptoglobin are bad, and more transferrin is good, inflammation wise. Artificial sweeteners decreased haptoglobin and transferrin, and had a null effect on crp. So, net here, the sweeteners had one good effect, one bad effect, and one null effect. And even the two non-null effects were \"doubtful that ... biologically important\".

In 2005-2015 dramatic improvements in image recognition and classification, speech transcription, game playing (e.g. Go and classic Atari), and automatic translation across many languages have approached or surpassed human levels. Since 2017 and the invention of the transformer model, and especially in 2020-2023, we've seen a rapid acceleration in the development of natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems. This has led to groundbreaking advancements in various applications, such as sentiment analysis, summarization, question-answering systems, and sophisticated chatbots that can engage in human-like conversations.\n\nIn recent years, AI models have been able to tackle more complex tasks, demonstrating an unprecedented level of comprehension and adaptability. The emergence of AI systems such as GPT-4 has brought us closer to achieving the elusive goal of general artificial intelligence, where machines can learn and understand any intellectual task that a human being can do.\n\nAs of 2023 there is still a large gulf, however, in many intellectual capabilities. But for how long?\n\nAssume that prior to 2030, a generalized intelligence test will be administered as follows. A team of three expert interviewers will interact with a candidate machine system (MS) and three humans (3H). The humans will be graduate students in each of physics, mathematics and computer science from one of the top 25 research universities (per some recognized list), chosen independently of the interviewers. The interviewers will electronically communicate (via text, image, spoken word, or other means) an identical series of exam questions of their choosing over a period of two hours to the MS and 3H, designed to advantage the 3H. Both MS and 3H have full access to the internet, but no party is allowed to consult additional humans, and we assume the MS is not an internet-accessible resource. The exam will be scored blindly by a disinterested third party.\n[Market creator] Metaculus Bot\n[Creation date] 05-06-2023\n[Closing data] 07-04-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Yes, can\u2019t find any sign of this market.

Each judge will provide the next judge with (<1 page) summaries of three ideas drawn from SEP posts which the judge is unfamiliar with. I will also pick (in consultation with the previous judge) three philosophical ideas generated by an AI -- curated to maximize likelihood of success. The judges will read all four ideas (3 SEP, 1 AI), and rank them in order of how impressed they would be if a peer had come up with the idea. If the AI generated ideas rank at, or higher, than 3rd out of 4 the judge will be considered to have passed the AI. If two or more judges pass the AI, then this resolves as Yes. \n \nThe AI ideas must be original, meaning as least as distinct as the difference between sections of the SEP. If there is reasonable doubt as to whether the AI generated text meets this bar in 2025, I will run the test anyway. Each summary provided to the judge will also provide some discussion of views developed prior to the idea, so the judges will be in a position to judge the creativity of the AI's work conditional on pre-existing work. Any amount of prompting, fine-tuning, etc. is allowed. However, in-context information (e.g. prompts) must not include ideas from the same subfield as the generated idea. \n\nThe SEP ideas in question will be selected to have varying interest levels, as judged by the curating judge and me. The ideas must be concisely expressible, e.g. things like Kripke's Hesperus thought experiment, the EDT\/CDT distinction etc. could qualify.\n\nTo be clear, it does not matter, for resolution, if the judges recognize which idea is AI generated. Nonetheless, I will attempt to summarize each entry in such a way that the source (AI\/SEP) is not clear.\n\nI may make minor adjustments to this protocol, but I will attempt to preserve the spirit as much as possible. For instance, SEP may be replaced with a better source if I find it hard to quickly curate self-contained ideas. But I will keep the principles of judge ignorance, non-adversarial nature etc. I may clarify the prompting criterion depending on how methods evolve. \n[Market creator] Jacob Pfau\n[Creation date] 01-25-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2026\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-02-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  \ud83d\ude2d  Awww thanks!!!\n---\n[Date]: 02-02-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:    Done I have edited the text to take your suggestion.

The time that counts is when the Speaker is  elected.\n","[Market title] Will a vote on a Republican-introduced resolution to vacate the Speaker of the House be held before July 1, 2023?\n[Market description] Resolves the same way as the corresponding Metaculus market. Its description is pasted below:\n\nKevin McCarthy was elected Speaker of the US House of Representatives on January 7, 2023, after 15 ballots, the first time since 1923 an election for Speaker required more than one ballot. The contentious election and concessions to the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 including rules that allow any member of the House to call for a vote that would oust the Speaker by simple majority \u2014 have weakened his position as Speaker.\n\nThe rules for the House of Representatives of the 118th Congress adopt those of the 117th Congress with some amendments. The relevant portion of the rules is Rule IX, the text of which is quoted below. The amended rules remove subparagraph (3) of clause 2(a) (shown in bold).\n\n1. Questions of privilege shall be, first, those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings; and second, those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct of Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner, individually, in their representative capacity only.\n\n2. (a)(1) A resolution reported as a question of the privileges of the House, or offered from the floor by the Majority Leader or the Minority Leader as a question of the privileges of the House, or offered as privileged under clause 1, section 7, article I of the Constitution, shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn. A resolution offered from the floor by a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner other than the Majority Leader or the Minority Leader as a question of the privileges of the House shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn only at a time or place, designated by the Speaker, in the legislative schedule within two legislative days after the day on which the proponent announces to the House an intention to offer the resolution and the form of the resolution. Oral announcement of the form of the resolution may be dispensed with by unanimous consent.\n\n(2) The time allotted for debate on a resolution offered from the floor as a question of the privileges of the House shall be equally divided between (A) the proponent of the resolution, and (B) the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, or a designee, as determined by the Speaker.\n\n(3) A resolution causing a vacancy in the Office of Speaker shall not be privileged except if offered by direction of a party caucus or conference.\n\n(b) A question of personal privilege shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn.\n\nThis question resolves as Yes if, before July 1, 2023, a member of the Republican Party introduces a resolution to remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House and a vote on the resolution is held. Both the introduction of the resolution and the vote must occur before July 1, 2023. Otherwise this question resolves as No. The outcome of the vote and any such resolutions introduced by representatives who are not Republicans are irrelevant for the purposes of this question.\n[Market creator] Tom\n[Creation date] 02-26-2023\n[Closing data] 07-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"44":["[Market title] Will Novak Djokovic win the 2023 French Open and become the Men's Singles All-Time Leader in Grand Slam Titles?\n[Market description] He's currently tied with Rafael Nadal at 22 and is currently in the semifinals of the 2023 French Open.

Of these, 373 are active, 125 have failed, and 85 have passed. Of these, 84 have been signed and enacted into law, for an average of roughly 8.5 anti-trans bills enacted per month. The others have not been signed or vetoed by their respective governors yet.\n\nIn 2022, 174 anti-trans bills were introduced in legislatures. Of these, 142 failed and 26 were enacted into law, for an average of 2 anti-trans bills enacted per month. So far, the rate in 2023 is five times higher.\n\nAccording to Trans Legislation Tracker, \"2023 marks the fourth consecutive record-breaking year for anti-trans legislation in the U.S.,\" with more bills focusing on denial of gender-affirming healthcare, control of education (e.g. banning pro-trans topics, not allowing students to be out at school but not at home), and \"drag bans\" that primarily target trans people. A federal bill that would prevent the government from recognizing the existence of trans people at all has, as of May 2023, 25 sponsors in the House of Representatives (though the bill cannot pass the Senate, probably cannot pass the House, and would be vetoed by Biden anyways). \n\nAny anti-trans bill that is enacted into law in 2023 counts, even if it is later repealed or struck down as unconstitutional.\n\nIf Trans Legislation Tracker no longer exists as of January 1, 2024, I will find another reputable source to count the number of anti-trans bills signed into law in 2023. I will try to keep the data cited above relevant by updating it at least once a month. The resolution criteria of this question will not change. As the website that will be used to resolve this question is publicly available, and the question resolves based on objective criteria, I will bet on this market. I don't believe anything could cause this market to resolve as N\/A, nor as a number below 84; I think it is unlikely for it to resolve above 200, but went for a larger range (up to 250) out of an abundance of caution.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 05-01-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will my partner or I experience transphobia while moving states?\n[Market description] This market resolves as YES if, at any point during our travel from the state where we currently live to the state where we will be living to attend grad school, my partner or I personally experience transphobia. Otherwise, this market resolves as NO upon us moving into our new apartment.\n\nBecause driving from our current state to our future state would take 38 hours of driving going only through blue states versus about 21 hours going mostly through red states, we'll almost certainly end up driving through some combination of two to four red states, all of which are among the most conservative places in the country. In particular, it is illegal for me to use the women's bathroom in one of the states, and probably illegal in another. The remaining states are highly conservative, which means even if I can't be arrested for using the women's bathroom, I'm at an elevated risk of being yelled at, chased out, threatened with violence, etc.\n\nMy partner is nonbinary, but is not visibly trans. I pass as a woman most of the time, but not always (and as I live in a progressive area, it's entirely possible that people have been \"clocking\" me as a trans woman and referring to me with the correct pronouns out of respect.)\n\nThis market resolves as YES using a common-sense definition of transphobia. That is to say: something must happen that causes me physical harm or significant emotional distress\/dysphoria, and it must be a direct result of anti-trans policies or someone openly discriminating against me because I am trans. Possible YES resolutions include:\n\nBeing arrested or harassed for using the bathroom that conforms with my gender identity rather than my sex assigned at birth\n\nBeing forced to use the bathroom that conforms with my sex assigned at birth due to fear of being arrested (being harassed is quite likely; as I said, I typically pass as a woman.)\n\nVerbal abuse from a stranger because I am trans - could include slurs, mockery, etc. (NOTE: This only counts verbal abuse directed at me or my partner from someone who is physically nearby; random transphobic comments on my social media, random transphobic texts, etc. do not count.)\n\nPhysical abuse from a stranger because I am trans - includes any action taken to harm me or my property (would include someone keying my car etc.)\n\nIn the (hopefully very, very unlikely) event that I am literally murdered as a result of transphobic violence, this market resolves as YES. \n\nVerbal or physical abuse that is not provably tied to my status as a trans woman - e.g. being honked at, having non-discriminatory insults yelled at me, being punched for apparently no reason - are not sufficient for a YES resolution unless I have strong reason to believe they happened as a direct result of me being trans. \n\nIf an incident sufficient for a YES resolution occurs, I will post a short summary of the incident in the comments shortly after resolving YES. I probably won't be able to provide proof, so you'll need to trust me. To ensure I have no incentive to lie, I won't bet on this market and will have no personal stake in its outcome (other than obviously hoping it resolves as NO.)\n\nThe close date is set to August 28, since that's when my partner and I will be moving in to our new apartment.

As of September 2023, eleven states (CA, CO, CT, IL, MA, MN, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA) and D.C. have shield laws, while three states (AZ*, MD, NJ) have executive orders accomplishing the same thing. This means there are fifteen states and territories with shield policies, which contain roughly 43% of the trans population in the United States.\n\n*Arizona banned surgical trans healthcare for minors in 2022, but the governor has issued an executive order that protects access to the trans healthcare that's still legal in the state.\n\nSince I want this to be at least a little bit of a prediction market and not a \"check the website on December 31 and just bet it to that number\" market, this market will close on December 1, 2024 and will not resolve until the end of the month. I will check the website - or, if the website no longer exists, a similar website - at some point on December 31, 2024 and resolve this market to the total number of states and territories displayed as having shield laws\/executive orders.\n\nIf the United States ceases to exist before December 31, 2024, this market resolves as N\/A.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 06-18-2023\n[Closing data] 12-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"47":["[Market title] Will there be more than 4 major analogues of ChatGPT by the end of 2023?\n[Market description] Resolves as YES, if there\u2019re more than 4 different companies providing general chat experience without major limitations with more than 10 million monthly active users in December 2023**.

For example: LLaMa. In the absence of model weights, it's not a chatbot. It's not even a language model. It's code for  training  one of the above, but if that code was applied to a different data set, it would yield a different thing. The reason we call these things \"chatbots\" and so on is because of how they're trained. (Related: scaling discussions necessarily include estimates of how much training data is available.) For all we know, with the right training data and enough compute, Karpathy's MinGPT might achieve ChatGPT-comparable performance. (In fact this is overwhelmingly likely to be true, right? \"Enough compute\" and \"the right data\" are doing heavy lifting here.) But MinGPT was available long before the creation of this market, and of course nobody thought that should yield a YES resolution.

Yikes! Kinda embarrassed that I missed that one, actually... I think it's unambiguous that LLaMa does not count---leaks aren't the same as open-source. That also excludes Alpaca, at least for now. (Of course, if LLaMa is to be \"officially released\" later, then that could make it count.) At the same time, I'm leaning away from actually invoking OSI's full definition ( https:\/\/opensource.org\/osd\/ ). That's very strict, and would exclude any chatbot developed with a term in the license that says \"you may not use this to destroy the world\". I don't think that's what anybody has in mind when they read this question. I think the requirements for this to resolve YES are: I'm  not  going to require that it be collaboratively developed, or anything like that. That's in some people's definition of open source, but not mine.

I think I'm requiring a conversational model, so I do mean ChatGPT rather than GPT3.5. I'm not at all confident that I can accurately compare official error rates between ChatGPT and another bot, which may choose to use different metrics. I can't see how to try DaVinci for myself; is there a place where I can? How do you feel about a cutoff of \"conversational, and better than anything appearing prior to ChatGPT\".

The model pretends to be an adversarial user to conduct thousands of different potentially harmful conversations with Bing to see how it reacts. As a result we're able to continuously test our system on a wide range of conversations before any real user ever touches it. Once we have the conversations, the next step is to analyze them to see where Bing is doing the right thing versus where we have defects. Conversations are difficult for most AI to classify because they're multi-turned and often more varied but with the new model we were able to push the boundary of what is possible. We took guidelines that are typically used by expert linguists to label data and modify them so the model could understand them as labeling instructions. We iterated it with it and the human experts until there was significant agreement in their labels; we then use it to classify conversations automatically so we could understand the gaps in our system and experiment with options to improve them. This system enables us to create a tight loop of testing, analyzing, and improving which has led to significant new innovations and improvements in our responsible AI mitigations from our initial implementation to where we are today. The same system enables us to test many different responsible AI risks, for example how accurate and fresh the information is.\u201d Excerpted from  https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/jtoPawEhLNXNxvgTT\/bing-chat-is-blatantly-aggressively-misaligned  Sara Byrd on the bing ai training\n---\n[Date]: 02-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:    Sorry if this elaboration does not align with how you imagined I would handle such cases.

But in general, only 48 percent of coup attempts they studied succeeded.\n\n\nThis paper might lead one to think there\u2019s perhaps a 3.5 percent chance of a successful regime-change coup against Putin in a given year (and it\u2019s hard to imagine a coup against him that doesn\u2019t constitute a regime change). Given all the stressors listed above, I think that\u2019s much too low an estimate. That said, the low overall rate of coups makes me think it\u2019s more likely than not that Putin stays in power.\n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"49":["[Market title] Will Bannon be convicted in New York in 2023?\n[Market description] Resolves YES if Bannon is convicted in New York state on any charges in 2023; otherwise NO.

Trump, is expected to surrender on Thursday to New York authorities to face state charges in an indictment that remains sealed\n\nMr. Trump pardoned Mr. Bannon in January 2021 before he could be brought to trial on federal fraud charges stemming from his work with We Build the Wall Inc., a fund-raising operation set up to help fulfill the former president\u2019s promise to create a physical barrier between the United States and Mexico.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, then headed by Cyrus R. Vance Jr., began its own investigation after the presidential pardon, which covered only federal charges.\n\nFederal prosecutors had accused Mr. Bannon and three other men in 2020 of cheating donors to We Build the Wall, which aimed to construct at least 100 miles of barrier on private land.\n\nThe authorities said Mr. Bannon hatched a plot to defraud donors with three other men: Brian Kolfage, an Air Force veteran and triple amputee from Miramar Beach, Fla.; Andrew Badolato, a venture capitalist from Sarasota, Fla.; and Timothy Shea, an entrepreneur from Castle Rock, Colo.\n\nThey were accused of taking money for personal expenses like hotel and credit card bills and to buy jewelry, a golf cart and a luxury S.U.V. The fund-raising effort collected more than $25 million, and prosecutors said Mr. Bannon used nearly $1 million of it for personal expenses.\n\nMr. Kolfage and Mr. Badolato pleaded guilty in April to wire fraud conspiracy in Federal District Court in Manhattan.

(on April 14)\n[Market description] Some of Joe Biden's lawyers discovered in his Delaware home some classified documents he kept from Obama's presidency.

This is a subjective market, but I'll do my best to resolve fairly. \n\nConservative media outlets will be weighted modestly: if liberal\/mainstream media stops covering it but it's a very frequent talking point on Fox News, for example, this will probably resolve NO, but YES if it's only an occasional Fox talking point. Other factors I may consider include: level of awareness among people I know (including those who don't follow politics), level of conversation on Twitter, and number of Manifold markets made on the subject.\n\nI will not bet on this market unless I feel it is very mispriced.\n\nGeneral policy for my markets: In the rare event of a conflict between my resolution criteria and the agreed-upon common-sense spirit of the market, I may resolve it according to the market's spirit or N\/A, probably after discussion.\n\nFeb 3, 7:00am: Will Biden's classified documents be largely forgotten in 3 months? \u2192 Will Biden's classified documents be largely forgotten in 3 months?

Two-stories bonus: 0\/1 Google search: 1\/1 ( https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/04\/11\/us\/politics\/congress-trump-biden-classified-documents.html ) Popular zeitgeist: 0.5\/6 People I know: 0\/2 (I polled people I knew in three places (fine, some of them were strangers on a crossword Discord server) about the classified documents. With the options being \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cMaybe briefly\u201d, and \u201cNo\u201d, the results were 0-1-4, 0-5-12, and 1-11-19. These clearly meet my cutoffs (>50% in the last category and >75% in the last two), so no points. I realize now that I phrased the points for this in the opposite way that I meant to, since the points are meant to represent remembering, not forgetting. Oops. So technically I\u2019m inverting the points. Anyway, zero.) Google Trends: 0.5\/2 (It\u2019s saying 2% for the last week, and (2-1)\/2 = 0.5.) Manifold: 0\/2 (literally couldn\u2019t find any from the last two weeks) Poll: ~2.8\/12 Result was 7-2 YES-NO unweighted. Of the voters, I only identified jack as also being a shareholder, but some people voted whose Manifold usernames I don\u2019t know. (I shouldn\u2019t have used this exact criterion.) I\u2019m just gonna call it 13-4, since (spoiler) the exact result doesn\u2019t matter too much. That\u2019s (4\/17)*12, or about 2.8. Even if all the YES voters were shareholders, it\u2019s only about 4.3 points. ConfluX-factor: 1\/6 There are certainly still some news articles about it here and there, but what impressed me today is how few people have thought about it at all recently. The classified documents aren\u2019t not literally forgotten in the sense that no one remembers them, but, like so many news stories that feel super major at the time they break, they seem to be mostly out of The Discourse, which is what this market was intended to measure. Therefore, with about 5.8 memory points out of a needed 10, it's not super close, and I am relieved from the duty of getting into the weeds: it is clear that the classified documents were \u201clargely forgotten\u201d, and I\u2019m resolving this market YES!

Therefore, I've prepared a point system! RESOLUTION POINT SYSTEM (which I will carry out April 14)\u00a0 I will award up to 30 \"memory points\" measuring whether the documents are \"largely forgotten by the media and the popular zeitgeist\". 10 memory points will be required for a NO resolution. Fractional points are possible in some cases. Anything that says \u201ccurrently\u201d etc below is actually as of yesterday.

Each article is worth 1 point, capped at 4. An additional 1 point is available if at least two different \u201cstories\u201d are included.\u00a0 (Currently I see 1 on Fox, which I might adjust downward since it's in the sidebar and just says \"Biden visits University of Pennsylvania campus for the first time since classified documents controversy\", and none on the other sites.) Then, I will google \u201cbiden classified documents\u201d and spend a few minutes trying to find an article from April from NYT, CNN, or Fox. If I find one, 1 point. Popular zeitgeist (6 points possible) I promised \"level of awareness among people I know (including those who don't follow politics), level of conversation on Twitter, and number of Manifold markets made on the subject\". So let's do that! Poll (12 points possible) I will do the simple thing and just post a poll on the Manifold discord with this wording: \"Do you feel that this market (link) on whether Biden's classified documents have been largely forgotten by the media and popular zeitgeist should resolve YES?\", with emoji reactions for YES and NO. Number of points is 12 times the proportion of NO voters.

(Currently I'm feeling like 1-2 points.) I'll tabulate these points, and if there are at least 10 (that's 1\/3 of possible points), I'll resolve this market NO. If there are under 10, I'll resolve YES. I reserve the right to change my mind about this if clear flaws are found in this point system, or override anything that ended up being a clearly flawed metric. Certainly it's very complicated.

I think currently it is in some circles and not in others (it isn't really in mine! but I don't read actual newspapers as much as some people; this affected my discussion with Gabrielle upwards in the comment thread), which makes me wish I was more clear about the weighting of the different factors I mentioned in my description.  Again, I hope to come up with something clearer soon, I'm sorry this became about forecasting how I personally interpret \"largely forgotten\". I probably will consult some people uninvolved with this market on what they feel are reasonable reference points. Maybe I'll do some polling.

Insisting that Trump\u2019s enemies are a scam is not a defense of his actions. It\u2019s not even an argument against his enemies. It\u2019s just your version of a DJT impression. You are right when you say he is benefiting from the attention. But it\u2019s not because he is being persecuted or whatever, it\u2019s because if the media weren\u2019t obsessed with talking about his sketchy behavior we would be well on our way to forgetting about him and his very forgettable presidency.

Move 15\n[Market description] This is a match between me and the commenters. Resolves Yes if I checkmate You. Resolve No if I am checkmated or the game ends with a draw. I will not bet. \n\nOne rule is added to the chess ruleset (it consists of two sentences, the second one is just elaboration). \n\nThe rule is \"fair\": it doesn't give advantage to any side, is symmetrical, does not depend on the move index.\n\nThe fact that I know the rule and others do not is the unfair part of the game. Commenters are encouraged to discuss and try to find out the rule during the game. Commenters are allowed to use programs and help from people even outside Manifold, and I am allowed none of that.\n\nAfter each my move I will comment with a picture of the current situation on the board. Team of commenters makes a move, when one makes a comment with the move description (similar to 1:Qa1-a2) and it recieves 3 likes from others. (My likes do not count, so I can't sabotage). If the move is illegal, commenters recieve another chance to make a move (unlimited). There is no time control. But i will try to make my move within 3 days. Closing date might be prolonged, do not take it into account.\n\nTo prove that the rule is created before the market, I've created a github private repo with the rule commited today, which i'll make public at the end if needed.\n\n+Upd. It was suggested to post a hash of the text containing the rule. MD5: 4f17d1b553afe8f7ffeb8cd88b6f2e8b\n\n+Upd2. If you are not planning to commit a move to be voted on and just want to test legality of several moves, you can write up to 5 moves in a single comment.\n\n+Upd3. The legality check is changed. From now there are \"3 potential moves per person per game move\" commenters can check. This is made to prevent spam and bruteforce.\n\n+Upd4. To overcome the \"like bug\" now to show that you vote for a move to be made, make a comment under the suggested move, start with \"+vote \".\n\n+Upd5. I don't want the game to be frozen, so i introduce a new mechanic. After each my move i will tell in the comments 4 valid moves for white: one best, one worst and two mediocre. But that is your job to understand which is what.\n\n(I still do not use computer help, all 4 moves are evaluated by me)\n\nYou DON'T have to choose one of these four, you can still do legality checks and propose your own moves as previously.\n\nClosing date might be prolonged.\n\nI had a peak of 1800 Elo in Lichess classical time control around 4 years ago I think.\n\nCommenters play white.\n\nCurrent position before move 16:\n\n[image]1. e4 b6 \n\n2.

In my original vision (before i added legality checks to speed things up) people would test their hypotheses on the board by moving pieces and seeing results\/my responses and speculating from that. If you were allowed to purely theoretically test them, you would never do experiments on the board. In second match I might invent some other mechanic to replace it, because legality check causes to many attempts to push the boundaries of the original idea. Upd. I wanted to see something like a scientific approach. People make a hypothesis, discuss risks, make move, observe results, adjust theories. With legality checks people immediately can deny hypotheses with no effect on the board.\n---\n[Date]: 07-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  also I want the situation on the board to keep its role.

And that is without legality checks. With legality checks the probability to face the rule is even higher, closer to 1.

This is compounded by the fact that of the 10 films Variety projects have the best chance at taking home the gold statuette, I\u2019ve seen precisely two: the honestly overrated Everything Everywhere All at Once and the 131 minutes of \u201cAmerica! Fuck yeah!\u201d that is Top Gun: Maverick.

And it is not, apparently, movies that audiences go to see. While nearly every Best Picture winner between 1980 and 2003 was among the 20 top-grossing movies of the year, only three winners since have cracked that list.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick isn\u2019t just the highest-grossing film of the year, it has nearly doubled the performance of its closest competitor, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Add that to its summer release \u2014 recently, the Academy has mostly preferred films released near the end of the year \u2014 and the odds are bad for the fighter plane flick. If I had to choose a winner, it would be T\u00e1r, because why wouldn\u2019t an industry facing an existential audience crisis choose a critically acclaimed film that no one has seen? But I do expect Top Gun: Maverick to take home the award for Best Visual Effects, both for the amazing, real-life dogfighting sequences and for whatever it is that keeps 60-year-old Tom Cruise looking ageless.\n\n(Vox)\n\nResolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  \n---\n[Date]: 03-14-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  would you be OK with resolving the market after, say, a week, and then having Manifold staff re-resolve it if Vox says that the movie did win?\n","[Market title] Will a High Frame Rate film win an Academy Award before 2030?\n[Market description] Background\n\nToday, most mainstream cinematic movies are made to be watched in 24 frames per second (FPS). This is despite the widespread availability of screens and cameras made for 60 FPS content. Services such as Youtube, Netflix and Vimeo already have the ability to playback content in 60 FPS.\n\nSome movies have been released in 48 FPS, such as The Hobbit, and some even in 120 FPS, such as Gemini Man or (parts of) Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, but none of these have had widespread acclaim by critics. One way to measure how much critics enjoy a film is the Academy Awards (known as the Oscars), which nominates and gives awards to films and directors & actors of films.\n\nResolution Criteria\n\nWe consider High Frame Rate (HFR) to be 59.5 or higher FPS. A film will qualify even if it is not HFR for the entirety of the film.\n\nThis question will resolve if an Academy Award is given to a movie that is released in HFR before it is nominated. The award must be in a category which already existed in 2023, excluding short film categories. When the award is given to a person, such as \"Best Actor\", then the movie they performed in to get the award must have been released in HFR.\n\nA movie is \"released in HFR\" if the general public can view the movie in HFR format, whether this is online streaming, in theater, on blu-ray, or some other way.\n[Market creator] Pazzaz\n[Creation date] 07-15-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2029\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  No, as it only had 48 FPS scenes, while this market is about movies with scenes with more than 59.5 FPS.\n---\n[Date]: 07-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I created a similar question on Metaculus a while ago ( LINK ), where they seem to predict a 45% chance of it happening before 2030.

I believe I intended \"a consensus by 2050 that direct-air carbon capture will eventually be responsible for half a degree less warming\". And on first re-reading that sounds like what the market description literally says: \"Pivotal by 2050\" and then for defining \"pivotal\" it says \"scientific consensus on eventual decreased warming\". But I see how you can get the opposite interpretation. The title refers to actually mitigating climate change and so the \"by 2050\" would lead you to believe that actual mitigation should've happened by then. The \"scientific consensus that carbon removal will end up being...\" in the definition of \"pivotal\" could be read as \"scientific consensus that carbon removal will have been...\" or \"scientific consensus that carbon removal has been...\". I.e., the \"will end up being\" could seem to be from our perspective now, not scientists' perspective in 2050. I think it would've needed the \"will have been\" or \"has been\" phrasing for that interpretation to be legit but I certainly appreciate the confusion now! Another potential way to address this is to consider which version makes the most sense for the spirit of the question. Half a degree less cooling thanks to carbon capture by 2050 seems like a pretty huge and pivotal mitigation that implies a decent chance of fully mitigating climate change long term despite business-as-usual emissions. Half a degree less cooling  ever  seems like something that might or might not turn out to be pivotal. So, oof, yeah, this is really tricky.

Ok, so, normally you buy shares of YES that pay out $1 each if the thing happens and $0 if it doesn't. (See the first section of  https:\/\/astralcodexten.substack.com\/p\/prediction-market-faq  for a nice primer on these basics.) But what if the thing  kind of  happens? You can have the YES shares pay out at X% of $1 if the thing \"X% happened\"! In this case maybe the market probability started at 50% because we had no clue if the answer would turn out to be yes. Then a few years later we still don't know but we're starting to have a pretty good guess that the answer is yes. Maybe there's now an 80% chance. So if you predicted YES back in 2022 then you've been somewhat proven right. You bought those shares at $0.50 and now they're worth $0.80 each. So you've made money. Not as much as if you waited for a definitive YES but maybe we don't want to wait that long. It's still theoretically perfectly fair. (Insert a bunch of caveats here.)

I think requiring creators to be  that  explicit up front in their resolution criteria is a pretty high bar.

I'd expect such a policy to cause people who want to keep their badge to avoid creating those sorts of markets, which is probably not what you want to incentivize? Also, if I recall correctly there were only 2 or 3 people who complained about my interpretation on the community guidelines market, and one person said it had  increased  their trust in my resolutions, so I don't think this is an entirely fair framing of what happened there. I think this largely hinges on whether the intention of delisting is \"these types of markets are allowed, we just don't want them on the homepage\", or \"these types of markets are not allowed, but the penalty for them is not very harsh\". If it's the latter, I will try to avoid creating more. If it's the former, I don't see how I'm setting a bad example.

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.economist.com\/china\/2022\/09\/01\/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd\n[Market creator] Marlon K\n[Creation date] 10-05-2022\n[Closing data] 12-31-2027\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] China will not launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan [in 2023]\n[Market description] This is one of Vox's Future Perfect predictions for 2023; they give it a 90% chance:\n\nPeople I take seriously are genuinely concerned that China is gearing up for an invasion of Taiwan this decade. Ben Rhodes has a thorough, thoughtful take in the Atlantic, and Phil Davidson, the retired admiral formerly in charge of US military operations in the region, has argued China will be ready for an invasion by 2027. Not controlling Taiwan is clearly a major psychic injury to Communist Party leaders, and taking over a world leader in semiconductor production that\u2019s strategically placed in the South China Sea would have geostrategic benefits, too.\n\n\nBut I have a hard time getting over the fact that an invasion would be outrageously costly for China in terms of blood and treasure and international esteem, and that these costs would almost surely outweigh any benefits. Mattathias Schwartz at Insider has a useful rundown of the challenges an invasion poses, not least of which is that Taiwan is an island and amphibious invasions are extraordinarily difficult. John Culver, a veteran CIA analyst on China, argues that there would be clear signs before an invasion, like \u201csurging production of ballistic and cruise missiles; anti-air, air-to-air, and large rockets for long-range beach bombardment; and numerous other items, at least a year before D-Day.\u201d\n\n\nWhile China has stepped up its probes of Taiwan\u2019s defenses, none of those warning signs are visible yet. We saw preparations for the Russian invasion of Ukraine months ahead of time; it wasn\u2019t clear whether Putin was serious or feinting, but he was definitely up to something. The situation with China and Taiwan just isn\u2019t the same, and the debacle that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine probably doesn\u2019t make Xi Jinping more inclined to repeat Putin\u2019s mistake.\n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 01-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  misclick\n","[Market title] Will Xi Jinping further toughen language on Taiwan during CCP's 20th Party Congress?\n[Market description] Resolved YES if Xi\u2019s 2019 assertion that the cross-strait division cannot \u201cbe passed on from generation to generation\u201d \u2013 or some other time-bound language \u2013 become official CCP doctrine in this year\u2019s work report.\n\nXi noticeably toughened the section on Taiwan in his work report to the 19th Party Congress. \u201cWe stand firm in safeguarding China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will never allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself.

China has never renounced the option of using force to annex Taiwan, but in high-level policy speeches leaders usually prefer to emphasize China\u2019s preference for \u201cpeaceful reunification.\u201d In that context, it\u2019s notable that Xi explicitly said this warning was \u201caimed at interference by external forces and the extremely small minority of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 splittists.\u201d In other words, Xi was giving a high-profile warning to the United States and the administration of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. And in case anyone in the Biden administration missed the point, Xi reiterated his opposition to any foreign involvement in the Taiwan issue, insisting that \u201cresolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese, a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese.\u201d Xi\u2019s actual speech at the Party Congress was only an abridged version of the complete work report. Interestingly, the  full version  did include the usual references to the \u201c1992 Consensus\u201d and \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d as the baselines of China\u2019s Taiwan policy.  But it\u2019s notable that the topline summary in Xi\u2019s speech left those out, preferring to focus on its warning tone rather than offering any positive vision for cross-strait relations.\n---\n[Date]: 10-16-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  This is basically the same tone as 19th congress.

Xi said China reserves the option of \u201ctaking all measures necessary\u201d against \u201cinterference by outside forces\u201d on the issue of Taiwan. Xi spoke firmly about China\u2019s resolve for reunification with the self-governed island, which Beijing considers part of its territory. \u201cWe will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort,\u201d Xi said in Chinese, according to an official translation. \u201cBut, we will never promise to renounce the use of force.

Counter starts now. Market resolved on\/shortly after 4\/25.\n","[Market title] Will Destiny cover the Mr. Girl Manifesto on stream?\n[Market description] Within two weeks of release. Market resolves \"No\" if there is no manifesto by the end of 2023.\n\nEdit 1\/7\/2023: For this market to resolve \"Yes\" Destiny must either watch the video released by Mr. Girl or read the article. If Destiny reacts to someone watching the video or reading the article the market will also resolve \"Yes\". Short clips will not count, Destiny must actively review the manifesto on stream.\n\nEdit 3\/13\/2023: Due to length and nature of manifesto evolving extensively, I'm going to offer a final clarification to this market. There is probably no criteria which will satisfy everyone, but I think this update embodies the original spirit of the market and remains in line with the previous update. In addition, I also think it's likely that it will be obvious once the dust has settled which direction the market should resolve. This market will resolve YES only if Destiny makes an effort to read, discuss, respond, or listen to the breadth of the article. Given the article's extensive length, singling out only a handful of particular sections (even if the sections are the most rhetorically significant) will not count. However, seeing as it is unrealistic that Destiny will read all 100+ pages of the article on stream, an engagement which involves skimming through the entire article, or skipping sections he finds irrelevant or uninteresting will still count towards YES. He does not need to respond to every point in the article, nor does he have to finish it, but if he engages with the larger revelations and analysis the market will resolve YES. Extensive discussion of the article will only count towards YES if that discussion encompasses a breadth of the article's content.\n[Market creator] Apencer\n[Creation date] 11-19-2022\n[Closing data] 04-05-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Mr Girl claim to have been made Suicidal by Destiny in his manifesto?\n[Market description] I will only count the title & body text of his official article. If there is dispute what the real manifesto\/article is, I will go by whichever document takes focus on Destiny specifically in relation to sexual impropriety, or if there are multiple, then whichever document makes up the majority of the video MrGirl uploads covering the \"manifesto\". If it's actually really unclear, I'll resolve to poll.\n\nAny phraseology is sufficient for a YES resolution. He must explicitly mention suicidality, suicidal thoughts, and at least infer that it is Destiny's fault.

If there is an entire section about suicide (as it seems there will be) then the \"explicit mention of suicidality\" may become a bit murkier, e.g. the explicit mention may be separated by other text by a significant amount. As a general rule though, the further away the explicit mention is from the self-referential negative feelings, the clearer he will need to be with those feelings. If he has been talking about suicide for 10 pages, and then half way down the 11th page of that section he says something like, \"I felt the worst I've felt in my life, I was feeling everything that [example person] was feeling\" or \"I felt this too\", it  may  be sufficient, depending on whether or not I expect that a reader unfamiliar with Max would interpret it as him suggesting his own suicidal ideation. As written in description, if I'm unsure I will resolve to poll. The poll (if necessary) will be shared here, and in at least one other place\n---\n[Date]: 03-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That would be sufficient. If he says \"I was suicidal\" at any point, unless he's explicitly talking about something else horrible that happened to him (e.g. \"I was abused by my Dad, it made me suicidal) Otherwise, connection to Destiny is assumed. If he says DGG made him suicidal, that would count. Note some other clarifications in these comments regarding the suicide reference itself. It needs to be explicit. Not just \"I was really, really, really, sad\", but he needs to say something explicit about suicide, attach it to himself (even if its vague, it can't be explicitly referencing someone elses suicidality) and also connect it to being Destiny's fault (DGG and their behaviour is also the fault of Destiny). The only exception to that I can think of is if he says \"but.. I don't blame Destiny for this\". Then it wouldn't count.\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think everyone who \"knows\" Max is probably already aware that the dude almost definitely wasn't suicidal (or we'd have heard about it), but I wouldn't put it past him to allude to the possibility that he was to mislead\/manipulate readers and embolden his narrative.\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  further clarification, if he quotes someone else saying \"I was suicidal\" - [name], that won't resolve this market YES.  That contains [ explicit mention of suicidality ], condition 1 but  does not meet [ reference to max ] condition 2, and  is unclear on [ because of Destiny ], condition 3 (as I have provided no context around the quote), although condition 3 will generally be autoapplied unless its a really out of context thing, e.g. MrGirl saying in a random screenshot or logs (contained within the article) to Lav 3 months ago, \"I'm suicidal\", if it's not implied that its because of Destiny, then I won't resolve based on that   if he says \" I was never suicidal, but I could understand if someone in my position did consider suicide \"? -> Resolves NO assuming no other  explicit  mention of his suicidality elsewhere in the article\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Because I think that someone reading that would infer that the writer was suicidal as well. The resolution criteria is, [explicit mention of suicidality, because of Destiny] + [reference to Max]. It doesn't have to be explicitly stating that he himself is suicidal. Just enough that a reader might infer he was suicidal - because he's mentioning suicidality, which makes little sense if he wasn't suicidal (unless, as stated, because it's explicitly relating to someone else).  To be clear, the line in the description that   has queried \" [in reference to himself] It is enough to make someone suicidal\"  has been there from the beginning.  If he writes  \" at no point was I suicidal \"  -> Resolves NO (assuming there is no other explicit contradictory mention of suicidality in reference to himself) If there is both \"I was suicidal\" AND \"I was not suicidal\" -> Resolves YES (as a reader would believe that he is claiming Destiny made him suicidal, at some point)\n---\n[Date]: 03-09-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  Some clarifying examples, where I substitute the end of this imaginary excerpt. Sample text:  \"This was really hard for me. I lost a dear friend. I loved steven. I still love steven. I miss him. I was really struggling. ------------------\" -- \" I wanted it all over, I wanted to die \" -- resolves YES -- \" I thought about how Destiny would have killed a weaker person \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" I could feel that Destiny could seriously harm, or kill someone \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" I would understand if someone in my position considered suicide \" -- resolves YES -- \" Suicide crossed my mind \" -- resolves YES -- \" Lav was suicidal, I was close \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" Lav was suicidal, it was difficult \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" Lav was suicidal, I struggled deeply too \" -- resolves YES (close call?) -- \" I thought about how if I didn't stop him, someone would die \" -- NOT sufficient -- \" I was harming myself \" -- NOT sufficient Keep in mind, it must be IN THE BODY TEXT OR TITLE OF THE ARTICLE.  Max can't say this shit on stream or embellish as he reads it. I'm being loose with the reference, because I doubt he will actually write in the article \"I wanted to neck myself\" or something like that, but he might write some artistic allusion like I wrote above. However, if he reads something that is a little fuzzy, like any of the examples above, and then says on stream \"Basically I was suicidal\", then I would interpret the \"fuzzy\" line a lot more suicidally- as long as it has an explicit suicidality reference. If it says \"I really hated myself at this time\" and then he says on stream while he reads it \"I was suicidal\", that still doesn't count. I will only resolve YES if someone reading the article could reasonably tie an explicit mention of suicidality to MrGirls state of mind, even if it's a  little  fuzzy. I hope that helps. Please submit any of your own examples, and I will pre-determine an answer. I really don't want it to be a vague decision, and if it is unclear how it should be resolved, I will sell my position and donate any profits to charity or other traders.\n---\n[Date]: 03-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Lav said in that stream with max that  she  was made suicidal.

For resolution of this question, official announcements of any of these scenarios suffice for positive resolution for as long as they are definite in their future implementation (for example, an announcement of a government bailout is sufficient for resolution, even if the actual bailout has not happened yet for as long as the announcement is clear that it has been agreed upon). Scenarios: 1) Collapse: Bankruptcy, insolvency, or general cessation of operations. 2) Full Acquisition: Acquisition of at least 50% of the voting shares by another financial institution. 3) Partial Acquisition: Sale of one or more of its business units or divisions to other financial institutions. 4) Break-up: Split of Deutsche Bank into at least two separate entities. 5) Government Bailout: Government-backed provision of financial assistance. 6) Central Bank Support: Direct intervention from the European Central Bank. 7) International Support: Financial assistance from international institutions such as the IMF or central banks from other countries.\n[Market creator] Metaculus Bot\n[Creation date] 03-25-2023\n[Closing data] 05-31-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Is the banking crisis contained?\n[Market description] At time of asking this question there were 3 banks* which have been seized in the US; all small-ish. \n\nIs the banking crisis contained?\n\nIf a larger banking contagion becomes evident in 2023 with two or more big failures or five or more (more) regional failures or some equivalent combination thereof (1 and 3, say) then this question will resolve \"no\". If January 1st 2024 comes around without a cascade of failures then \"yes\".\n\nA bailout counts as half a failure.\n\nI'll be refraining from betting in here, since this is a slightly fuzzy resolution.\n\nEdit: Current count since the first three: (4 Nov 2023)\n\n1 Major seizure (First Republic)\n\n1 Major bailout\/acquisition (Credit Suisse)\n\n1 Local failure (Heartland Tri-State, $140M)\n\n1 Local failure (Citizens Bank of Sac City, $65M assets)\n\n\"No\" resolution tracker:\nIf a major failure is 3 points and a regional failure is 1 point, for combined purposes 6 points will trigger \"no\" resolution.\n\nWe're currently at 4 1\/2 points out of those 6 (1 1\/2 pts from the CS bailout, 3 pts from the First Republic seizure, 0 pts from local banks incl Heartland and Iowa)\n\nFAQ from the comments:\n\nInternational banks with significant US presence, like CS, UBS, Deutschbank, etc., count.\n\nIMF bailouts of central banks count as well\n\n\n4 Nov 2023 clarification:\nOn local vs. regional\n\"local\" being something different from \"regional\" and the lower end of regional being set at $10B assets is within the intent of this market, and the wording in the description. In case there's a contagion wave of smaller banks I'll add together the estimated assets of all banks below $10B, and if the sum hits $10B by the end of the year that'll count as another regional faillure. See \"current count\" above.\n\nOn fuzziness\nBonini's Paradox lives. I haven't bet in this market as mentioned above. When edge cases come up they will continue to be adjudicated in accordance with 1) the larger intent of the market, as represented by the original question, and 2) words chosen in the description, in that order. Fortunately, in this case, both are in alignment. The intent is to resolve on a systemic contagion becoming evident in 2023, and a 2-branch local bank going under doesn't have much to do with that, and shouldn't. \n\nMy bad\nI missed that heartland was that small, originally. Lumping it into the \"local\" resolution category, and bringing the current points down from 5 1\/2 to 4 1\/2. Sorry for the confusion, I think this is the right answer.\n\nPlease continue to refrain from attempts to read the tea-leaves and find some definitional edge that means I have to resolve the market some counter-intuitive way.

A \"sneaky plan\" must be surprising and non-obvious. \"I thought I could buy enough shares to overcome the minnows\", \"I thought another whale would jump in and help me\", or any other plan that uses the natural mechanics of the market in a straightforward way doesn't count, even if Isaac expected it to happen last minute to pounce on the minnows. Examples of a sneaky plan would include taking out a secret loan from @NinthCause (or any similar pact that would metaphorically fit the description in this poem: https:\/\/manifold.markets\/IsaacKing\/will-the-whales-win-this-market#OglNi20vSFIk6EvS70nZ), paying people to bet NO and then switch to YES last minute, or manipulating the mechanics of the market in an unusual, unintuitive way that people didn't see coming.\n\nMinnows ultimately win the market because they overcame Isaac's plan. This could be by getting enough points that his plan wasn't enough to overcome it, or by performing some specific action to prevent him from executing it (e.g., convincing someone not to give him a loan or paying people to stay on Team NO). If Isaac's plan is thwarted by some outside factor (e.g., he had a plan involving alt accounts that was thwarted by Manifold's new rules), it doesn't count, unless it is clear that the minnows would have been able to thwart it anyway.\n\nNote:\n\nMinnows MUST win the WvM market for this to resolve YES. If they lose even after thwarted some plan of Isaac's, then that means that at best they only thwarted Plan A or delayed the inevitable.\n\nIf Isaac's plan required the market to stay open for longer, then minnows will be considered to have thwarted it, since the current procedure for resolving the market probably wouldn't be in place if it wasn't for minnows arguing that the market should close earlier.\n\nThe first criterion here is similar to the one used in this market: @\/CodeandSolder\/does-isaac-have-a-trick-up-his-slee. However, it is not identical. In particular, Isaac does not actually have to do something \"unexpected and interesting\" for that criterion to be met - it is enough that he planned to do something, even if he never attempted to execute it since minnows had already foiled it. \n\nSome people have already offered to sell their NO shares if they are paid to do so. If Isaac takes them up on their offer, that is not enough to meet the first criterion, unless he already had plans to do this with a lot of people beforehand.\n\nI will use my best judgement, but if there is sufficient disagreement over whether Isaac's plan should count as \"sneaky\" or not, I may resolve this to PROB.\n\nIf Isaac doesn't have a sneaky plan, this resolves NO, not N\/A.\n[Market creator] Plasma Ballin'\n[Creation date] 04-21-2023\n[Closing data] 04-30-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Pretty obvious resolution here.

On the other hand, it obviously doesn't seem correct to say that minnows didn't thwart Isaac's plan if they end up way ahead in the point totals like they are now, even if the market resolves N\/A rather than minnows winning.

Since Isaac did indeed pull off a sneaky plan by buying off an army of accounts to dwindle the minnows' numbers, we have definitely met condition one. And the plan actually worked without being thwarted by outside factors, so if minnows in fact win, it means they thwarted the plan with the last-minute giant recruiting push.

The only outcome that definitely guarantees a NO resolution here is whales winning the market.\n","[Market title] Will the resolution to the whales vs. minnows market be controversial?\n[Market description] A lot of people seem to be afraid that the whales vs. minnows market will be misresolved, or at least resolved in a way that some people disagree with. But will the ultimate resolution even be controversial?\n\nThis market will resolve YES if I notice significant disagreement over the resolution itself or whether factors that led to the resolution were handled fairly. This would include, for example, disagreements over the list of alt accounts, controversy over the time of the market closing, or credible accusations that someone knew the time that the market would close and used that to their advantage. However, any such controversies have to be over factors significant enough to affect the resolution - if people disagree whether a specific account is someone's alt, but the market would resolve the same way regardless, that is not enough for a YES resolution here.\n\nOne obvious way this could resolve YES is if any of the derivative markets claims that Isaac has resolved the market incorrectly by some metric (assuming that the derivative market isn't unambiguously agreed to have resolved incorrectly). However, this market could still resolve YES even if all the derivative markets agree that the original was resolved correctly, as long as there is some significant controversy among traders.\n\nI will also take into account how sincere the disagreements are. If someone seems to be just claiming that they disagree with the resolution to get this market to resolve YES, I will ignore them. I will also ignore anyone who is just being a sore loser by contesting the results, unless they can make a serious case that it shouldn't have been resolved the way it was.\n\nWhales vs. Minnows:\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/IsaacKing\/will-the-whales-win-this-market)\n[Market creator] Plasma Ballin'\n[Creation date] 04-09-2023\n[Closing data] 05-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-01-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]: Well, no new information has been brought to my attention since my previous comment, and no one has complained about the NO resolution in the comments on WvM, or anywhere else that I noticed.

Minnows were ahead at every single suggested close time, so the arguments over the closing time did not ultimately affect the resolution. You could claim that, counterfactually, whales might have been ahead earlier if the closing time had been set to earlier, but I have already stated that I'm not going to consider a counterfactual argument like that when determining what affects the resolution, since it's impossible to verify. Similarly, none of the controversies about the exclusion of alts, Isaac's use of API keys, or the mana refund affected the resolution, so they don't count either.  Currently, the only argument that seems to be serious and good faith for why the market should not have resolved the way it did is  's argument that it should have resolved N\/A. Others have expressed a similar sentiment, but I can't find anyone else making statements strong enough to conclude that they disagree with the NO resolution (I thought I found  such a statement  from   on the Manifold discord, but he has since then edited it to cross out the comment, leading me to assume that it was either just a joke or that he no longer agrees with it). I don't think that statements from only a single person are sufficient to count as \"significant disagreement\", and it's also not yet clear whether it's actually the resolution that Odoacre disagrees with, as opposed to the allowance of the market (see  here ). I will leave this open for a little longer just in case something else comes up and to give people an opportunity to bring any new evidence of controversy to my attention. However, I don't think there is sufficient controversy, and I will resolve this market NO if I am not given any new reasons to resolve it YES soon.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I don't think that's very good evidence, though. This market is currently much lower than 50%, which suggests that most people think that the WvM market is, in fact, not controversial. People might be holding a YES position because they misread or misunderstood the resolution criteria (e.g., you were initially confused about why it hadn't already resolved YES because you didn't realize that the controversies over close times, alts, and API keys wouldn't count if the market resolved NO). They could also be holding YES shares because they believe that the probability that my judgement differs from theirs is >9%. Also, I don't think the volatility of this market is a sign at all. The big swings in this market were a result of the big swings in the WvM market, since the outcome depended significantly on how WvM resolved (e.g., it went up to >90% at the same time that WvM did, since I had already stated that this market would resolve YES if WvM resolved YES). Ever since it became clear that WvM was going to resolve NO, this market has stayed fairly stable, with a few spikes that were quickly corrected and just now a large drop as the resolution actually came, eliminating any possibility of an N\/A resolution or a sudden whale comeback.\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  So, would you consider your disagreement to be more of a disagreement with the existence of the market itself (or at least its continued existence), rather than the resolution? Now that it has resolved NO, do you think that the council has made the wrong decision? (You can keep or sell your YES shares if you want. Even if it did influence my decision, that would just mean that your holding the YES shares gave me some information that I considered relevant to the resolution, which isn't a bad thing. The only person whose shares could unduly affect the resolution is me, and I already sold all my shares and avoided buying any more once it looked like the resolution might require a judgement call).\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  This doesn't seem like a reasonable complaint to me, and I haven't heard anyone else complain about this, so I'm not inclined to consider it a significant disagreement.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Some of these are just predicting N\/A, though, and even the ones that suggest that resolving the market N\/A would be good don't really seem to be saying that resolving to something other than N\/A would be a misresolution.

None of these comments give me a strong enough sense that the users would disagree if the market were to resolve NO. I agree that these comments are reasonable and sincere, the question is just whether they are enough to constitute a controversy if the WvM market resolves NO. My current thinking is that these comments alone aren't enough to prove that a NO resolution is controversial. If it does resolve NO, though, I will try to get the opinions of people who previously made statements in favor of an N\/A resolution to see if they disagree with the resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 04-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Feel free to make that market if you want.

So the controversies over the close time and Isaac's use of API keys to turn technically real accounts into alts in all but name would only count if WvM resolves YES (which is why I have stated in previous comments that this market will definitely resolve YES if WvM resolves YES). If it still resolves NO in spite of these things, then the NO resolution will be uncontroversial (assuming no other controversies), since it would have resolved NO whether or not the time was extended and whether or not Isaac used API keys, and therefore, people on both sides of these controversies can agree that the NO resolution is correct. At this point, since WvM is very unlikely to resolve YES, the main controversy that could affect the results is controversy over whether it should be N\/A'ed. If it does resolve N\/A, I would probably consider it controversial, since I assume it would be perceived as another bailout for Isaac (but unlike the mana refund, it would be a controversial bailout that actually affects the resolution), and people would argue that it should resolve to a definite answer, since one side has a definite lead in points. But if it resolves NO, I'm not sure whether it would be controversial or not. I have seen people arguing for an N\/A resolution, and if they still argue that it should have been N\/A'ed even after it resolves NO, I would definitely count that as enough to make the resolution controversial. If everyone seems to accept the NO resolution, though, even people who previously suggested N\/Aing it, I don't think I would count it as controversial.\n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Where things stand now: A YES resolution seems very unlikely, but if it somehow does happen, it would count as controversial, even though that controversy is probably not really the first thing on people's minds now. Some have suggested an N\/A resolution, which would probably be controversial, since people would see it as bailing out Isaac and some would lose their profits. A NO resolution seems most likely, and probably the least likely to be controversial, but if enough people argue for an N\/A resolution, a NO resolution could still be considered controversial. \n---\n[Date]: 04-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I don't consider that part of the resolution. This is only meant to refer to the value that it gets resolved to: YES, NO, N\/A, or a probability. The only form of bailing Isaac out that would count is if the market resolves N\/A in light of the drama, and people argue that this is just a bail-out for Isaac. Manifold giving Isaac a refund for the mana he bought won't affect the final outcome of the market, so it won't count here, even if it is controversial.\n---\n[Date]: 04-25-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Also, maybe I should have stated this more clearly in the description, but my intention was always that, if there was reasonable doubt over how the market would resolve if a controversy was handled differently, then it would count as \"significant enough to affect the resolution\". For example, if the controversy over the closing date had been reversed (people wanted it open longer, but it closed earlier), then I would have resolved this YES even though we wouldn't know for sure whether the earlier close date really affected the resolution. I only meant to rule out things that unambiguously didn't affect the resolution with that clause (e.g., if minnows had been winning at the original close time, and then still won).\n---\n[Date]: 04-25-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  It may indeed be true that, counterfactually, Team Whale still would have won if the market had resolved earlier. But that is also impossible to verify, so I don't think that it's enough to say the controversy didn't affect the results. I have already stated in previous comments that the controversy will be considered to have impacted the results if one team is in the lead at the original close time, and then the other team wins, which (assuming Team Whale wins) is what happened. Since I already said that this was how I was determining the significance in the comments, I don't think I should go back and that and base it on hypothetical reasoning.\n---\n[Date]: 04-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That is pretty much correct. As I mentioned below, the controversy over the closure date will be considered to have affected the result iff Team Whale wins. There's a small typo, though: The close date is the 24th + random, not 27th + random.\n---\n[Date]: 04-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  The price in the WvM is non-predictive, but markets whose outcomes are correlated with non-predictive markets should still have that correlation reflected, since otherwise people can make dutch books.\n---\n[Date]: 04-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  In the description of this market, I stated that only a controversy that actually affects how the WvM market resolves is enough to make the resolution count as controversial. In other words, if Team Minnow wins, and would have won no matter what, this market will resolve NO, since the NO resolution of the WvM market won't be controversial (It may be controversial how it should have resolved, but everyone will agree that NO is the correct resolution, which is what this market is about). So the outcome of this market isn't guaranteed, and is now pretty much completely dependent on the outcome of the WvM market.\n---\n[Date]: 04-20-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Update: As I assume everyone here already knows, there is now an official time that the WvM market is set to go into pseudorandom mode, decided by a council of three users. It is set to do this on April 24, although the council agreed that April 17 was when it should have happened based on the original description.  If the market had gone into pseudorandom mode in accordance with the original description, it would have already resolved, since a Bitcoin block with a hash ending in 00 has already been mined since April 17:  https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/explorer\/blocks\/btc\/786174 Since Team Minnow was in the lead at the time when this block was mined, the controversy over the close date will be considered to have affected the result if and only if Team Whale ends up winning. (This assumes that it doesn't resolve N\/A, which I think is a valid assumption given that the council has decided on a resolution procedure, and not to N\/A it). In other words, this market is more or less guaranteed to resolve to the same result as the WvM market.\n---\n[Date]: 04-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Today is the day that the WvM market would go into pseudorandom mode according to the common interpretation that it should do so a week after the original close date if it doesn't look like it will close anytime soon by the other method. Team NO has a substantial lead, and I assume they will keep that lead for the rest of the time the market would be open according to this interpretation. However, it appears that Isaac intends to keep the market open for longer. If both of those assumptions are true, then this market is pretty much guaranteed to resolve in the same way as the WvM market itself (unless the WvM market resolves N\/A). So I'm not sure why this market is 10% higher than WvM.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  To be clear, I still think that this market is more likely than not to have a clear resolution. I outlined some cases above, and I think the first two are almost certain to lead to either an unambiguous NO or an unambiguous YES. Those are also the cases I think are most likely. The third, fifth, and sixth cases could be ambiguous, but they could also be very clear. The fourth case could make it somewhat difficult to resolve this market, but even then, it might be obvious, and I think the fourth case is very unlikely to happen anyway. My comment wasn't really meant to imply that I don't know how I should resolve this market, just that it's  possible  that we end up in a situation where I'm not sure how to resolve it. In that case, I would consider resolving it N\/A, but only if I am really uncertain about my own opinion and there is no consensus among others for how it should resolve. My plan is to either resolve the market on my own if it is obvious, and otherwise to get the opinions of traders to see if we can come to a consensus. If not, I would still consider resolving it according to a poll, rather than just N\/Aing it.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Since this depends on both the outcome of the WvM market and how people react to that outcome, it is hard to say exact how I would resolve it in every case, but based on the current debate, here is what I'm thinking: To be clear, even in the situations that I think might lead to an ambiguity, I think it is still possible that it becomes obvious when the time comes, since people who disagree with the resolution will make their disagreements known.\n---\n[Date]: 04-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I am slightly worried that the resolution to  this  market could become controversial under certain circumstances, since it is still somewhat ambiguous what counts as controversial, even though I've tried to clarify it as much as possible. I would make a market about that, but it wouldn't make sense for me to be the one to judge whether my own market is controversial, since, in the event that it really is controversial, it would be my own judgement over what is and isn't controversial that's called into question. If anyone else wants to make a market about it, though, that is perfectly fine with me. In the event that it really is hard to determine whether the resolution to the WvM market was controversial, I will discuss it with traders here and possibly in the original market before resolving.\n---\n[Date]: 04-12-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Update on how I am inclined to resolve this: The original disagreement mentioned below was about whether \"in a week\" refers to \"a week after market creation\" or \"a week after the original close date\". It seems like the disagreement over this has faded now that it has been clarified to refer to the original close date rather than the date of market creation, so I'm not sure whether I would count it as controversial if that is the sole ambiguity that affects the results. I think if that ends up being the deciding factor, I will try to get the opinions of people who originally interpreted it the other way and see if they are okay with the resolution. Personally, I think this is a reasonable clarification, but this is about whether there will be controversy, not whether I think the ultimate resolution is correct. Now, though, it seems that there are bigger disagreements over the closure time, mainly because of the vagueness in what \"meaningful progress\" means and because there is seemingly a contradiction between, \"If after a week it looks like it won't be closing any time soon, I'll close it at a pseudorandom time within the next few days,\" and \"the market will remain open for as long as it looks like meaningful progress is being made towards its final state.\" I think I would resolve this market YES if the latter factor affects the ultimate resolution to the Whales vs. Minnows market. In other words, if the market doesn't switch to pseudo-random mode at most a week after its original closing date, and this affects the resolution, I am inclined to resolve this YES. For the other factor (the definition of \"meaningful progress\"), I think it depends on whether all sides of the debate can come to a consensus before the market closes.\n---\n[Date]: 04-10-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: There is currently controversy over the closing time of the market. The description had some ambiguities over when the market will switch to \"pseudo-random mode\", and many people bet on it assuming that it would close earlier that it might actually end up closing. I would be inclined to resolve this YES if this ambiguity affects the ultimate resolution, unless people who were confused about the closing time say that they would have bet the same way regardless, or that they don't have a problem with the final resolution once it comes. As Isaac stated below, people questioning the final closing time is the most likely way for the outcome to be controversial. Also, one user suggested to resolve the market N\/A due to the ambiguity. Isaac has already stated that he won't do this, but if he changes his mind and ends up resolving N\/A, I expect that to anger many people and would probably consider that a controversial resolution as well.\n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Lol, I fixed the typo now \n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yes, I wouldn't consider misreading the description to be a credible reason to contest the resolution. \n---\n[Date]: 04-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That's my assumption as well. It seems very unlikely that the list of alt accounts would determine the outcome, and even if it does, I imagine that no account will be on that list unless it's pretty clear-cut. But the closing time is much more likely to affect the outcome and require some judgement calls to determine. \n","[Market title] Whales vs. Minnows: Will traders hold at least 10000x as many YES shares as there are traders holding NO shares?\n[Market description] Team Whale gets 1 point for each 10,000 YES shares they collectively hold.\n\nTeam Minnow gets 1 point for each trader holding NO shares.\n\nThe team with the most points at close wins.\n\nThe market stops normal trading activity at 18:30 Pacific time on April 24th. At this time, it enters \"pseudorandom close mode\", where it closes as soon as a bitcoin block is mined with a hash that ends in \"00\". (With 144 blocks per day and hexidecimal hashes, this means it'll likely resolve within 2 days.) I probably won't be online at the exact time the block is mined, so I'll just resolve the market whenever I get back and see that this has occurred. (It'll resolve based on the state it was in at the time the block was mined; any new investements from team Whale or new traders on Team Minnow afterwards won't count.) The information source on bitcoin hashes and mining times we'll use is here.\n\nAll NO shareholders count towards team minnow's points, except:\n\nAny account that has declared itself to be an alt, and is not a bot account.\n\nAccounts that have been banned from Manifold.\n\nA \"bot account\" refers to any account with the \"bot\" tag that is clearly not human-controlled and has a good reason to exist as a separate account. (e.g. @acc and @Botlab)\n\nIf anyone is suspicious that an account may be an undeclared alt being used to unfairly inflate team minnow's points, (which is a violation of Manifold's community guidelines), they should report that account to Manifold using the \"report\" button on that account's profile page. Market resolution may be delayed for up to a month after close to allow Manifold to investigate these reports.\n\nThe resolution council may choose to disqualify some suspected alt accounts, even if Manifold has not banned them.\n\nNote that I phrased the market description in terms of \"points\" to make it more intuitive, but the title is the technically correct resolution. i.e. Team Whale can get fractional points, and they'll win a tie.  (But a tie is extremely unlikely, since buying just 1 more share can break the tie.)\n\nGiven the disagreements and ambiguity about this market's close date and resolution criteria, and the fact that I'm both the market creator and one of its largest shareholders, I have delegated its management to @jack, @Conflux, and @MartinRandall. They have final say over all descisions, and it's effectively \"their market\".\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 04-03-2023\n[Closing data] 04-29-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Usually the word \"cheating\" refers to  breaking  the rules.

They decided to change this clause to \"The AI must not have access to the problems before being evaluated on them, e.g. the problems cannot be included in the training set. It should also be reasonably verifiable, e.g. it should not use any data which was uploaded after the latest competition.\" I'm leaning towards making the same change.

What are people's thoughts?\n---\n[Date]: 12-06-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Oh, and for the \"easily reproducible\" point, you could imagine someone cherry-picking working solutions by hand perhaps. I agree the major AI labs wouldn't do this, but if it's a bunch of people applying existing models to the IOI problems, they could easily do this sort of cherry-picking without even explicitly trying to cheat.\n---\n[Date]: 12-06-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Yeah, I agree with that, but I can imagine a scenario where the major AI labs don't directly work on the IOI (maybe they target a different contest instead). And then the contest is won by someone tweaking that or a future GPT or whatever and applying it to the IOI task. Then it could become harder to tell whether the training was indeed done beforehand.\n---\n[Date]: 12-06-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: The intent of the rule is to avoid the case where someone fine-tunes their AI to be able to solve the specific problem set after the problems are published. Open to suggestions for a better operationalization though. One alternative I was considering was just letting people fine-tune as much as they wanted - it would still be a pretty impressive result I think.\n---\n[Date]: 12-06-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: There is no way for AIs to compete undercover.

I copied the IMO grand challenge rules there, except I removed the open-source requirement. What I meant by easily reproducible only requires that the inference be reproducible, not the training - so you have to be able to run it and generate the results for yourself, but you do not necessarily have to publish source code, training data, weights. So even something like GPT-3 would count, even though it is closed-source, because people can query the API and reproduce the results.\n"],"70":["[Market title] Will @NamesAreHard reach top 10 of all time trading profits leaderboard in 2023?\n[Market description] Clarification: I will resolve YES if @NamesAreHard reaches the top 10 at any point by the end of the year, NO in January 2024 if they haven't reached the top 10 at least once by then.\n\nPer the comments below, I will not discount profit spikes as long as they 'stick' for a few hours (at least until the next update).

He has had a complex relationship with Donald Trump, with some periods of collaboration and others of conflict.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Rand Paul was one of several candidates seeking the Republican nomination. He criticized Trump on some issues, including his lack of foreign policy experience and his proposed Muslim ban. However, when Rand Paul suspended his campaign in February 2016, he did not endorse any of the remaining candidates.\n\nAfter Trump won the Republican nomination, Rand Paul eventually endorsed him in June 2016. Paul cited Trump's positions on issues like immigration and regulation as reasons for his support. However, the endorsement was not enthusiastic, and Paul continued to criticize Trump on some issues, including his use of executive power.\n\nIn the Senate, Rand Paul has generally been a supporter of Trump's policies but has also been critical of some of his actions. For example, Paul has been a vocal critic of Trump's foreign policy, including his support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and his decision to assassinate Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nIn recent years, Rand Paul and Donald Trump have had some public disagreements. For example, in 2021, Paul criticized Trump for his role in the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, saying that Trump \"bears some responsibility\" for the violence. However, Paul has also continued to defend Trump on some issues, including his allegations of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOverall, Rand Paul's relationship with Donald Trump has been complex, with some periods of support and others of criticism. While Paul did eventually endorse Trump in the 2016 election, his support has often been lukewarm, and he has been willing to break with the former president on some issues.\n[Market creator] Brian T.

Ashley has warned (promised?  we're a weird fanbase) that the conclusion will result in \"so much blood coming\" and so I'm putting this market together as a \"casualty pool\".  \n\nI wanna know which characters, from chapter 17 page 145 till the end of chapter 17 (see note!), will be significantly injured, mortally wounded, outright killed, or otherwise impacted in some significantly deleterious way they wouldn't\/didn't want.\n\nExamples of what I mean by the latter: getting key memories or bits of personality memory wiped, Duane being rendered incapable of his present pymary-zombie existence somehow, someone's soul being Khert-swallowed or something, etc.  Examples of \"significantly injured\" - Toma's arm qualifies.  Jivi's ear doesn't.\n\nEdit - 2023-07-05: Manifold used to have a multiple choice \/ free response format, but they've paused those temporarily to overhaul multiple choice.  So the options for this question are limited to the seven main cast characters I added.  Let's hope we can get a true free-response pool going for Chapter 18!\nFor a character to count, they must meet one of the following:\n1. Named character with at least one page appearance\/speech bubble so far, or\n2. Unnamed background character with a notable feature\/job\/role, or who has had a spoken interaction with a named character per 1, and at least two page appearances (\"the shopkeeper\" from the start of the chapter, \"pymaric chair lady\").\n\n(Feel free to add someone you think qualifies, but I reserve the right to not resolve them as a yes if in my judgment they don't meet the casualty or the significance criteria.)\n\nAlso - the injury itself need not appear.  If a character who would qualify mentions that something qualifying occurred, but we don't see it, that will count.  (Something like - final encounter, blinding pymaric effect, black out, afterwards someone says \"there's no way they survived that\").  Yes, this does leave us open to ending up being wrong later on in the story.  But Ashley's done that before, hasn't she?   \ud83d\ude01 \n\nNote - I am intentionally making this about chapter 17.  Ashley just dropped a hint that she might add a chapter 18 to the story, and so I am going to clone this market for that possibility.

This isn't true, neither when it comes to legal or general definitions. Sex trafficking is trafficking persons for sexual exploitation. Sexual exploitation concerns a whole lot more than \"forcing someone to do sex acts\". Even your example of supposed non-sexual exploitation involves soft-abducting them to another country without a way out and leaving them as their only option to join his sex work organisation and then being scammed off the profits of their sex work. I don't want to put some arbitrary requisite like mentioning the word \"sex\" because it removes all nuance (even contextual synonyms like \"nude camera work\" or \"self-penetration acts\" would be out at that point).

Regardless, Andrew Tate's reasons for trafficking these women,  were  he to have trafficked them, aren't really up for debate.

The information, he says, has been illegally withheld from Congress, and he filed a complaint alleging that he suffered illegal retaliation for his confidential disclosures, reported here for the first time.

He further alleges that the Intelligence Community has intentionally withheld classified evidence of \"intact and partially intact craft of non-human origin\" and fragments \"of exotic origin (non-human intelligence, whether extraterrestrial or unknown origin)\" from congressional oversight. This has led to an ongoing investigation in response to his whistleblower complaint.\n\nOn the other hand, the Department of Defense has stated that the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AARO) has not found any information substantiating claims of any programs related to the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials. They, however, assured their commitment to following the data and the investigation wherever it may lead.\n\nThis prediction market seeks to speculate on whether David Charles Grusch's claims will be substantiated by December 31, 2023. The resolution of this market will be based on official reports or statements from the authorities involved in the investigation, such as the Office of Naval Intelligence, AARO, or any other relevant government body.\n\nFor the purpose of this market, 'substantiated' will mean that the claims made by Grusch are officially confirmed as true in part or in full by the investigating authorities.\n\nThis is a YES or NO market.\n\nYES: The authorities have officially confirmed that some or all of Grusch's claims are true by December 31, 2023.\n\nNO: The authorities have not confirmed Grusch's claims, have refuted them, or have not released any statement regarding the claims by December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the event of ambiguous or contradictory statements from different authorities, the market creator will make the final decision based on the preponderance of the evidence.\n[Market creator] Franklin Baldo\n[Creation date] 06-06-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 06-08-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:   https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/UFOs\/comments\/141up7z\/pentagon_aaro_response_to_david_grusch_claims_of\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button Got it here\n","[Market title] Will a Chinese Spy Balloon be shot down over the continental US in 2023?\n[Market description] See ABC \/ CNN.

Ross?\n[Market description] See this Vox article for a good primer on why this case is important:\n\nNational Pork Producers Council v. Ross \u2014 hinges on a simple question: Can California set its own standards for how pigs are treated on farms, even when they\u2019re raised in other states?\n\nThe case centers, quite literally, on how sausage gets made in the US. Each year, over 6 million female breeding pigs, or sows, are raised in \u201cgestation crates\u201d \u2014 narrow metal crates that confine the pigs so tightly they\u2019re unable to turn around for the duration of their four-month pregnancies (and they have about four pregnancies in their three- to four-year lifetimes). As the pioneering animal welfare scientist Temple Grandin once put it, the crates are akin to forcing a human to live much of their life in an airline seat.\n\nThe American Public Health Association says confining pigs so intensively also increases their stress levels and weakens their immune systems, which makes them more susceptible to infectious disease. (And given the ease with which some zoonotic viruses can pass from swine to humans, that threatens us as well.)\n\nIn 2018, over 62 percent of California voters supported a state ballot measure called Proposition 12 that would ban the crates and require sows be raised with at least 24 square feet of space. Importantly, the measure applied whether or not the pigs had been raised in California, so all whole, uncooked pork sold in the state would be required to be produced according to California\u2019s standard. Given the vast size of the state\u2019s market, it\u2019s having a transformative effect for pigs across the country \u2014 just as California\u2019s stricter emissions standards for automobiles have changed the way cars are made nationwide.\n\nThe law has similar provisions for cage-free eggs and crate-free veal, which have already gone into effect \u2014 the challenge in the Supreme Court only covers pork, which will go into effect in five months.\n\nSee also this question on Metaculus: \n\n(https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/embed\/11624\/)I will likely resolve according to however Metaculus decides this question, unless anyone presents a better-specified resolution criteria.\n\n\nClose date updated to 2023-12-26 11:59 pm\n[Market creator] Austin\n[Creation date] 10-20-2022\n[Closing data] 05-11-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will we see major supply shortages across multiple markets in 2023?\n[Market description] Will there be major news organizations running stories on supply shortages of at least five different consumer goods (e.g., toilet paper, cars, infant formula, etc.) that are in short supply across the USA for longer than a week? \"Fad\" shortages, e.g., not enough Tickle-Me Elmos for xmas, do not qualify.

That said, it does look like the carton shortage probably counts. It looks like one of the major manufacturers fell short on supply, impacting multiple states, and other suppliers have not been able to pick up the slack and are no longer taking new orders. There is the wrinkle that we have a previous clarification (in the thread below) this that components of consumer goods do not count if the shortage does not result in a shortage of consumer goods; and the cartoon shortage does limit the distribution of milk, but arguably does not result in a shortage of milk. However, given that a large part of the role of milk in our society is to provide government subsidies to dairy farmers, and this significantly restricts that, I would accept it. (Or to put it another way, the major consumer of tiny milk cartons is the government, and they will not shift to gallon jugs; the market is not satisfied with the available supply chain).  However, I won't count it before giving others a chance to present counterarguments.  TLDR; if you don't think that milk cartons count as a shortage, post your arguments here!\n---\n[Date]: 12-07-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  As per comments above, my current count is at 4\/5. \n---\n[Date]: 12-07-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  However, I should add that while US rice looks dead-on what it was a year ago, it is way up in cost from it's low low plummet in June of this year.

As far as rural locations are concerned, my guess is that the most likely solution is a chain using an already existing vegan crust and sauce with frozen Diaya cheese (or similar), so there doesn't need to be much in the way of added costs for a rural location -- and rural locations are also more likely to grab a big chunk of the local vegan market with any offering provided. \n---\n[Date]: 01-25-2023\n[Likes] 7\n[Text]:  I am insisting on the presence of cheese because it was stated that the pizza needed cheese in the original description, and lots of people have placed bets under the assumption that it was required.

However, I hadn't considered the possibility of a chain saying \"we're doing this for two weeks, then it goes away\"; that seems very low-probability, since you can't get new vegan customers to stick around if you take away the vegan option.  I \/think\/ I should count a New Year's Special vegan pizza as a valid YES resolution, although a very unlikely edge case. I am open to thoughts on this; the spirit of the question is that I, you, or pretty much anyone else (in the USA) should be able to access the pizza in question, and if it's available for just one day, that's a pretty limited interpretation of commonly available. But at the same time, the question does specify \"by the end of 2024\", and New Year's Eve is a reasonable interpretation of \"by the end of 2024\".  However, if you simply mean the case of a vegan pizza being introduced next month, failing quickly, and no longer being available at the end of 2024, that would resolve as a NO. \n"],"81":["[Market title] Will US inflation be above 3.4% in June 2023?\n[Market description] Will year-on-year inflation exceed 3.4%?\n\nResolves YES if CPI-U is above 306.385 in the June 2023 release (to be released July 12th)\n[Market creator] Chris Billington\n[Creation date] 05-10-2023\n[Closing data] 07-12-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 06-30-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  added to the description.\n---\n[Date]: 05-11-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Much inflation pessimism on this website!

I don't suggest putting lots of play-money into this market; it's going to resolve based on my subjective enjoyment of a video game.\n\nReasons a YES outcome is possible:\n\nI loved Breath of the Wild - it's my favorite game ever - and I've been excited for the sequel since the moment it was announced. I know that the gameplay, music, etc. will appeal to me.\n\nThe world is bigger, and there are more ways to interact with it (including creating vehicles). Link's new abilities look fun, as do the various new\/reworked enemies and bosses shown in the third trailer.\n\nThe story looks very, very interesting. In particular, I have been fairly invested in it since the third trailer.\n\nI am better at video games now than I was in 2017, so I shouldn't struggle as much with bosses or difficult enemies.\n\nI have heard nothing but positive things about the game from the people who have played it.\n\nMy life is on a broadly positive trajectory at the moment, and this will likely be even more true in May (Update, May 5: it is.) It's easier to enjoy things when I'm feeling well.\n\nReasons a NO outcome is possible:\n\nSome of my love for Breath of the Wild may be nostalgia, since I played it at a very positive time in my life. I may be somewhat burned out on the \"formula\" of Breath of the Wild after playing it twice. Also, the bar is just set really high; Breath of the Wild is my favorite game. It would take something really, REALLY good to displace it.\n\nThe basic landscape of Hyrule has not changed much, even though many details of it have.\n\nI'm not THAT good at video games, so if the difficulty is significantly increased, I might still struggle with it.  \n\nI'm on an SSRI, which tends to blunt my emotional reactions to things, so I might not be capable of enjoying TOTK in the same way I enjoyed BOTW.\n\nThis market resolves as YES if, after completing the main story of Tears of the Kingdom, I feel that I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild. In the unlikely event that I have completed (by my estimate) half or more of the story content in the game, and have liked that half significantly more than I liked the first half of Breath of the Wild, this market resolves as YES.\n\nThis market resolves as NO if, after completing the main story of Tears of the Kingdom, I feel that I enjoyed it less than I enjoyed my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild. It also resolves as NO in the very unlikely event that I dislike the game enough that I stop playing before completing the main story.\n\nThis market resolves as N\/A if I somehow manage to enjoy Tears of the Kingdom exactly as much as I enjoyed my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild. I will be able to play Tears of the Kingdom when it is available on the North American eShop. If I have not finished the game by the closing date of the market, I will move the closing date to give myself enough time to finish the game. \n\nDLC is NOT taken into account. This is a first playthrough to first playthrough comparison, and this market should resolve well before TOTK has any DLC. (The closing date is the start of July because I should complete the game by mid-late June; I'm busy, but not THAT busy.)\n\nNote that while I expect YES to win, I will resolve this market fairly, and resolve it entirely based on my actual experience playing the game. I am going into the game with an open mind, and this market is not guaranteed to resolve in any particular way.\n[Market creator] shgfshggsgshgf\n[Creation date] 04-07-2023\n[Closing data] 05-18-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Zelda be playable in \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\"?\n[Market description] A pre-release gameplay demonstration will suffice for YES.\n\nSep 14, 11:22am: Will Zelda be playable in the sequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\"? \u2192 Will Zelda be playable in \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\"?\n\n\nClose date updated to 2023-05-12 12:00 am\n[Market creator] N.C.

The intent of this market is mainly to gauge the likelihood of this feature in a consumer-purchasable device, so it gets fuzzy when you release something \u201cintended for developers\u201d. For example, something akin to Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro or Mac Pro lines would count, since it\u2019s purchasable by anyone, but some kind of heavily-restricted dev kit that you have to apply for would not.  Historically the only time I can remember Apple ever releasing a proper dev kit was when they released  some early Mac Minis as their first computers with Apple Silicon.  You had to apply for that, and the computers had to be \u201creturned to Apple at the end of the program\u201d, so something like that wouldn\u2019t count in my book.  If it gets really fuzzy\/controversial I might have to resolve to N\/A but I\u2019m going to try to avoid that and stick to these principles.  Also, because this resolves on announcement and not release, I expect it would be unlikely that they would release a screenless dev kit without announcing an eventual consumer product at the same-ish time. \n---\n[Date]: 01-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Related market on a potential software feature:\n---\n[Date]: 01-06-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Sure, that counts as a \u201creproduction\u201d of them in my book. \n---\n[Date]: 01-05-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: The Information  has reaffirmed their story on the presence of this display once again.  https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/01\/03\/report-reveals-wave-of-features-for-apple-headset\/\n","[Market title] Will facebook anounce a future integration of Oculus with a brain machine interface before the end of 2022 ?\n[Market description] This question resolve to yes if during an event or in an official press release, facebook or one of its big subsidiaries announce working on integrating a brain machine interface to an oculus product or to another facebook owned, hardware platform for virtual reality.\n\nThe question was prompted by this articles where it says that in 2017, facebook revealed that it was working on a brain machine wearable interface. \n\nhttps:\/\/roboticsbiz.com\/the-history-of-brain-computer-interfaces-bcis-timeline\/\n\nAug 21, 4:26pm: \n\nAug 21, 5:03pm: \n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-11-13 10:48 pm\n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-12-31 11:55 pm\n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-11-14 1:00 am\n[Market creator] yomun\n[Creation date] 08-21-2022\n[Closing data] 11-14-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-14-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for the input!

He mentions that it lets you control an ar or a vr device. ( He says he can't show us the facebook ar device  in the demo for now ) The description of the market mentionned  \"during an event or in an official press release, facebook or one of its big subsidiaries announce working on integrating a brain machine interface to an oculus product or to another facebook owned, hardware platform for virtual reality.\" * * A demo of a working prototype by the CEO of Meta during (one of ) its most important yearly communication event is as close as possible to, and in my opinion qualifies as, an official announcement. More important it's a clear signal by Meta leadership that integrating neural imputs with XR devices is a strategic path they are working on.  They sent that signal this year, earlier, than any of us would have anticipated.  By resolving the prediction market, I am going with what I think is the spirit of the bet while staying  close to the letter the bet. But more importantly I think it provides more social utility to bettors and bystanders to resolve it, since if we go by the current odds of the market, it updates  dramatically our prior beliefs regarding facebook future and its prospects as an investment.

(Affordable Homes Now, Nov 2022)\n[Market description] Refers to Proposition D, in the San Francisco, CA 2022 November general election, according to https:\/\/sfelections.sfgov.org\/.\n\nThis proposition is currently titled \"Affordable Homes Now\" and requires a bare majority to pass. From the Affordable Homes Now website:\n\nWhat is the Affordable Homes Now Initiative?\n\nA new ballot measure that will make it faster and easier to build new homes in San Francisco that are affordable to low and middle income San Franciscans, public school teachers, and others who work in public schools or at community colleges.\n\nWhy is Affordable Homes Now necessary?\n\nBecause San Francisco has a severe shortage of affordable housing, and that\u2019s in large part because it takes too long for the City to approve permits for new homes. (By \u201ctoo long\u201d we mean four to seven years!) Those delays then drive up the overall cost of housing and SF becomes even more unaffordable.\n\nHow does Affordable Homes Now solve this problem?\n\nBy streamlining the permitting and approval process so that it becomes faster and easier to build affordable and middle-income housing for our lower and middle income workers such as teachers, nurses, firefighters, small business owners, nonprofit workers, and others.\n\nWill the Affordable Homes Now measure have labor standards for the construction workers building the new housing?\n\nYes. This ballot measure requires that builders pay construction workers family-supporting prevailing wages and cover the workers\u2019 family health care costs.

Let's see if he's \"proposed and\/or debated an LVT policy measure.\" From the article: \"That's why Addison said he pushes for a tax reform that would tax land value separately from the building and potentially lower taxable value of the property itself. \"If we looked at decoupling our property, the home versus the land, we could look at how zoning dictates value changes of the land itself. Then we tax what the land is worth rather than being dependent on what the building is,\" Addison said. He said this approach would create an incentive to build on vacant parking lots and encourage development. Addison added, as a land-locked city, it would give Richmond more economic control. \u201cThe land\u2019s value is dictated by very controllable assets: zoning type, density, height, usage, proximity to other assets, parks, schools, facilities, etc. It becomes a very different formula than just depending on, 'hey, look, the interest rates went down, people are buying and selling homes, my assessment value goes up, the city makes more money,'\" he said. While land value taxation is not widely known or practiced, Addison said City Council approved a study and community engagement process that would analyze the possible impacts of implementing such a reform. Results will take about six to nine months.\" That certainly seems like it qualifies on both of these measures:  - Elected officials proposing and\/or debating an LVT policy measure  - Commissioning a new report on the subject that they haven't already done as of the posting of this question Based on the above evidence, this resolves YES. I'm surprised nobody noticed this opportunity sooner, a lot of free money to be made.\n"],"90":["[Market title] Will Destiny hit a 900 (or above)\n[Market description] Only for the 2nd attempt of this stream (december 10th)\n\n1st attempt was below 899\n\nYES if 900 (or above 900)\n\nNO if 899 (or below 899)\n\nIf there was a full miss of a keypress (meaning the keypress didn't register at all) that makes the score go below 900, the attempt will not count.\n[Market creator] Butidigress\n[Creation date] 12-10-2022\n[Closing data] 12-11-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d have an anime original ending?\n[Market description] Resolves \u201cYES\u201d if the remaining AoT anime story significantly differs from the manga \u2013 as soon as that can be determined.\n\nResolves \u201cNO\u201d otherwise \u2013 when the complete story is released.\n\nMay resolve \u201cN\/A\u201d if the production gets canceled.\n\nMinor stylistic polish, editorial rearrangements, and truncations don\u2019t count.

But we haven't implemented that, we just default to 10 years in the future as an approximation to an ongoing goal. Which is bad and we have a bigger overhaul planned, but this is about a tiny change that might help a little.\n\nNamely, we can just change that \"now + 10 years\" to the Schelling-like \"2099-12-31\" to make it slightly more clear that it's a proxy for \"forever\" or \"ongoing\". (Thanks to Clive Freeman for the idea!)\n\nOf course, someone confused or frustrated to see that they're seemingly committed for 10 years (they're not) probably isn't going be any less so if it's 77 years. But also probably not any more confused. \n\nAnd it's a small step in the right direction. For example, the UI could treat \"2099-12-31\" as a special case where it displays \"this goal is open-ended; click to set an explicit end date!\" We can't do that with the current \"now + 10 years\" scheme.\n\nThis resolves NO if we get a credible complaint about increased confusion or frustration. Otherwise it resolves YES. In case of ambiguity, I intend to resolve to the market price, assuming the market price stabilizes.\n\nPS: If anyone objects to either a YES or NO resolution -- i.e., has a reasonable argument for why YES or NO would be incorrect -- that would count as ambiguity.\n\nPPS: Note the clarification about weak vs strong Pareto improvement in the comments but I don't think this is turning out to matter because (not counting bugs introduced -- see the comments for that as well!) it is turning out to be a strict improvement.

Achieving this level of interpretability for a neural network like GPT-3 would involve creating a binary computer program that is interpretable by expert human programmers and can emulate the input-output behavior of GPT-3 with high accuracy.\n\nBefore January 1st, 2030, will mechanistic interpretability be essentially solved for GPT-3, resulting in a binary computer program that is interpretable by ordinary expert human programmers and emulates GPT-3's input-output behavior up to a high level of accuracy?\n\nResolution Criteria:\n\nThis question will resolve positively if, before January 1st, 2030, a binary computer program is developed that meets the following criteria:\n\nInterpretability: The binary computer program must be interpretable by ordinary expert human programmers, which means: \na. The program can be read, understood, and modified by programmers who are proficient in the programming language it is written in, and have expertise in the fields of computer science and machine learning. \nb. The program is well-documented, with clear explanations of its components, algorithms, and functions. \nc. The program's structure and organization adhere to established software engineering principles, enabling efficient navigation and comprehension by expert programmers.\n\nAccuracy: The binary computer program must emulate GPT-3's input-output behavior with high accuracy, as demonstrated by achieving a maximum average of 1.0% word error rate compared to the original GPT-3 model when provided with identical inputs, setting the temperature parameter to 0. The accuracy must be demonstrated by sampling a large number of inputs from some diverse, human-understandable distribution of text inputs.\n\nNot fake: I will use my personal judgement to determine whether a candidate solution seems fake or not. A fake solution is anything that satisfies these criteria without getting at the spirit of the question. I'm trying to understand whether we will reverse engineer GPT-3 in the complete sense, not just whether someone will create a program that technically passes these criteria.\n\nThis question will resolve negatively if, before January 1st, 2030, no binary computer program meeting the interpretability and accuracy criteria is developed and verified according to the above requirements. If there is ambiguity or debate about whether a particular program meets the resolution criteria, I will use my discretion to determine the appropriate resolution.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 04-14-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2030\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will LLMs' non-language capabilities be used commercially by the end of 2023?\n[Market description] Copywriting, translating, conversing, semantic search, data labelling, text summarisation, and code generation are all established uses of LLMs that are being commercialised. I am interested in whether large language models (LLMs) \u2014 which are also referred to as foundation models \u2014 will have their capabilities extended beyond the natural language domain, in a reliable and commercially sustainable way. Will I believe this has happened by the end of 2023?\n\nThis resolves positively if the nature of its use is extended by being given an interface with other software, but there has to be evidence of it being used (sustainably) for real commercial applications. A simple demonstration will not suffice, nor does it count if its usage is for experimental\/R&D purposes (as opposed to direct commercial ones).\n\nIf there is software that can design architectural models, or perform accounting tasks, and is fundamentally based on an LLM \u2014 that counts. The LLM cannot just be an added feature that does some natural language tasks on the side, it must actually drive the software's core functionality.\n\nA lot rests on what I consider to be \"notably different\" in nature, but if you give me examples of new capabilities, I'll let you know what I think.

I'm not going to resolve it yet because I want to see \"evidence of it being used (sustainably) for real commercial applications\". I realise ChatGPT is a commercial product on its own, but the intention is to resolve this only if the non-language capabilities LLM-based software are commercially viable. But you're right to be buying yes shares, in my opinion, as these integrations make this very likely; there's a lot of scope to use that setup for solving a non-language business problem. I personally expect the code interpreter plugin is what's going to resolve this first:  Greg Brockman on Twitter: \"Plugins for processing a video clip, no ffmpeg wizardry required. All I'm waiting for are reports of it being consistently used end-to-end for something like that (processing a video clip) for revenue-generating purposes. Generating the code isn't sufficient (that counts as a language task) but taking a file and spitting out what people want definitely is \u2014 the idea of something like ChatGPT replacing standalone video processing software is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind. So basically, all that's left is having good evidence that this kind of capability is being used for commercial applications. There probably just needs to be a video of an established content creator demonstrating how they use ChatGPT as part of their regular workflow, or something like that.

I don't think any factor would be sufficient, since the nature of usage wouldn't be different.  However, if there was LLM-based software resembling a software engineer more closely, that would count. The difference needs to be that its capabilities are notably extended beyond language (ie beyond just code generation). If it can (for example) autonomously compile a program, run it, alter the source code in response to the errors\/output, and repeat \u2014 then the nature of its use just changed. I'm sure someone could spin up a prototype of something like that (if they haven't already) but there would have to be evidence that businesses use it (and not just experimentally) to resolve this positively.

If a language model exists that is undoubtedly the most accurate, reliable, capable, and powerful, that model will win regardless of popularity (provided, at least some members of the public have access).\n\nIf there is dispute as to which is more powerful, a significant popularity\/accessibility advantage will most likely decide the winner. There must be public access for it to be eligible.\n\nThe three main metrics for assessment:\n\n1. Popularity and Accessibility\n\nAssessed in real-terms. Total users and engagement (if public), otherwise I will defer to google trends or other publicly available data which can provide relative measures of popularity. \n\nThis metric is arguably most important, but is not the only factor as if an Android or iPhone AI gets pushed to existing OS, the existing assistant leaders in those areas (e.g. Siri, Google Assistant) will have a meaningful advantage, irrespective of product quality. \n\nThe popularity and userbase elements are essentially being used as a substitute for \"usefulness\".\n\n2. Accuracy and Reliability\n\nAssessed against a common set of questions or data, to be determined. I expect there will be studies or other academic materials published which I hope to refer to. If these papers conclude that \"ExampleRacistBot\" is more accurate than chatGPT because of censoring, etc. then \"ExampleRacistBot\" would be the more accurate model.\n\n3. Power & Capability\n\nTotal computational ability, based on whichever metrics seem most relevant at the time. Right now those might be: \n\nNumber of Parameters\n\nTokens\/words processed\n\nProblem-solving abilities\n\nTrainability (an example of an ongoing trainability exercise with GPT4: @\/Mira\/will-a-prompt-that-enables-gpt4-to \n\nIf there are any recommendations for Power & Capability metrics, please let me know. The biggest issue I see is that if I establish which metrics are most important (say; number of parameters, like everyone did for GPT3) we may end up in a situation like we are now, where GPT4 parameters are not disclosed. Expect this criteria to change over time.\n\nResolution Assessment\n\nWhen the final assessment is being made, if there aren't reliable competitive grounds for comparison, the following series of checks are how I see the decisionmaking process going.\n\n\nFirst check: Popularity. If one model is evidently significantly more popular (like >50% market share, or more popular by Google Trend metrics, etc.), then it will be considered the best unless there is evidence suggesting an alternative public AI is more accurate and powerful. If multiple models are within a similar frame of power and accuracy, popularity will determine the winner.\n\nSecond check: If there are multiple models of similar popularity, accuracy and power will determine the winner. If there are no good academic comparisons for accuracy, I will endeavour to conduct my own, but I'm really hoping someone else figures that out before I have to. Accuracy seems more tied to \"usefulness\" than power, but if there is a significant breakthrough in power such that one has a capability advantage over the other (like advanced logic problem solving) while maintaining accuracy, and for whatever reason it's not more popular but still public, that will win. \n\nThird check: If there are multiple models of comparable popularity (or there is terrible data available) and there is no real clear difference in the capability, power, or accuracy - the decision will be deferred to more specific considerations, like a Google Trends comparison (relative search popularity) or the number of parameters (provided this is public, and still a respected metric)\n\nIf the decision becomes highly-subjective, I will sell all of my positions, donate the profits, and defer judgement to someone I deem to be an expert (and have reasonable access to) who will make the final call. I'll probably just email professors until I get a response, or ask someone enrolled in a related course at the time to ask their professor to respond.\n\n[ Taking advice for updates or any proposed criteria changes ]\n\nCompeting for @AmmonLam's subsidy\n\n[Changelog]\n\n01\/05\/2023: Description updated to reflect thoughts expanded on in comments\n[Market creator] Genzy\n[Creation date] 05-01-2023\n[Closing data] 12-31-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-16-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Definitely worth typing, and you bring up something important I am willing to defer to people with more AI expertise, but afaik GPT4 is rumoured to be an MoE which basically sounds like 8 models Frankenstein'ed together. If someone else launches a client that Frankenstein's multiple models (that aren't openAI's) and somehow it's better than the best openAI product\/model\/whatever - that should count. However, it can't be something like poe which just plugs you into the different models, it would need to be one input field (within reason, as chatGPT has multiple input fields where you can modify your prompts by telling it your name\/job\/etc) that makes the selections behind the scenes and provides an output. I should also say though, the comparison is for the \"language model\" part. I don't think any multimodal stuff should impact the decision here outside of the impact it will inevitably have on the popularity or market share\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  The main reason is because if one org undeniably creates an AGI that is publicly available, it seems possible that openAI could use that AGI to improve their own to be competitive and retain their current market share If another company has a serious breakthrough, or finds a better way to improve accuracy (e.g. by removing all corporate bloat) I don\u2019t want openAI to have a chance to copy their success However if openAI are cooking up something more akin to \u201cSimultaneous invention\u201d, e.g they have their own improved model that is \u201cbetter\u201d but it\u2019s built differently and they\u2019ve had it in the back for a while, then I\u2019ll wait to see what they release If you haven\u2019t already, read my comments\/replies to others too \ud83d\ude04\n---\n[Date]: 12-12-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Nah I think it would be cringe to do that, the way I wrote it just now in a comment below: BUT If they're super close, or even within the same league, I think we should wait.

I'll wait and see what they have. My bias (despite my bet) is to resolve this NO if Google\/whoever are making nerd technical arguments that their AI is actually a very slightly better model but they haven't got any consumer market share (which is the current situation)\n---\n[Date]: 12-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   It doesn't necessarily need to be a \"model\" to count, if there was a chatGPT-like application that was better than GPT4, that would be the reference point. It's really about the best consumer product, I guess. The question is ultimately about the best from openAI vs the best everywhere else. Whichever is \"the best\" will win If someone releases a model that is better than the best available openAI model, then this market will resolve YES. However, as it seems extremely unlikely that openAI are going to \"fall off\" in a major way and make the resolution obvious, I will likely be comparing the best LLM's publicly available at the end of the year. The world vs openAI.  If Google released Gemini-Gigachad which was a confirmed AGI that never made mistakes and could beat stockfish at chess, I would resolve YES immediately. As a note, I have absolutely no intention on resolving this YES because of Gemini, and it will only be considered if down the road their best version is made available and it is either widely used or confirmed to definitely be better.

I have found (disappointingly) that the ChatGPT stats are mostly just based on website visits (1.6B in March), and I expect that regular users for the assistant software I mentioned would outnumber GPT (both Siri and google assistant have estimates around 500Million users, roughly 25% of iPhone users use Siri to search for shopping products) I am trying to find a more reliable metric and am open to the use of Google Trends comparisons. I will update the description to reflect this. As for comparing the computational ability, I am relying on the fact that there will be some competitive motivation for benchmarking in the next two years (\ud83d\ude4f). I'm a little hesitant to put exact conditions as there may be new scores or tests that become relevant over time, but if you or anyone else has a metric they want noted\/recorded (that will hopefully be made public by the AI publishers) then I will take it on board. I will update the description to reflect this further, and I intend over time to consistently adjust the \"Power & Capability\" criteria in line with consumer expectations for outputs and what data becomes publicly available.  Ultimately, the mention of multiple criteria is to primarily establish that something like an Android\/iPhone AI push won't count simply on userbase, and that a less powerful, more reliable AI would only be in contention if it was also extremely popular - given that in this case, popularity is a proxy for usefulness. If my judgement becomes a key factor in this, and its highly disputable, I will defer to an expert (or a group of experts) if it is possible (I also have no issues donating any profits & closing my position).\n---\n[Date]: 05-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I mostly added the diversity of metrics because I didn't want it to be an autowin if Apple pushed some product to every iPhone that is 80% as good but defacto more popular because it's free and accessible. It doesn't necessarily need to be winning all 3, but if it were an undoubtedly better model, more powerful and more accurate, it would win despite being less popular. I will think of a better way to explain this in the description.

The organization must identify itself as \"Effective Altruist.\" (Even if other EA groups denounce them as a fake EA movement, their self-identification will still count.) If the organization does not identify as EA, but they adhere to a philosophy that is widely recognized as a splinter of the original EA movement, then the \"or equivalent\" clause will be true. The human rights abuses are deemed to happen \"for the greater good\" if the organization uses utilitarian arguments to justify their crimes. The criteria for \"serious human rights abuse\" will be taken from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it existed in 2022. The data for resolving the claim will come from a reputable news source.\n\nI will use my best judgment to determine if the group's identification as EA is authentic. For example, if a street gang or a violent performance art group starts to identify themselves as EA, it's unlikely that I'll take their identification seriously. On the other hand, if a local LessWrong chapter uses a GoogleSheets-based utility calculation to justify a killing spree, then this claim resolves as YES (even if EA people say \"that wasn't real EA\"). \n\n\n[Market creator] Harrison Lucas\n[Creation date] 11-30-2022\n[Closing data] 12-31-2034\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Nota bene: if EA group members commit a terrorist attack on a data center hosting a LLM, people there die, and the EA group takes credit for the attack, then this resolves as YES.\n---\n[Date]: 02-13-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for the explanation, makes sense.\n---\n[Date]: 02-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  yes\n---\n[Date]: 02-12-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Last 48 hours people have added $2000 of liquidity to this market.

I won't mark this claim YES for something so indirect. You could also say that the EA group is violating human rights by paying sales tax which funds a police department that engages in police brutality. If interpreted that broadly, this is unambiguously YES. That's not the intent of the claim -- that's no fun, not interesting, not informative. I was thinking something more like \"a EA group reenacts the Stanford Prison Experiment because for some reason they believe false imprisonment in the present will prevent suffering in the future\" -- well, that's a YES. A EA group starts a death camp for people who are unwilling to accept reason. YES. An AI researcher says \"I'm close to achieving AGI and I don't care what that empty shirt huckster grifting Yudkowsky says about alignment, I'm going to press the big red button and load the thing onto the Internet\" -- then a EA group assassinates the AI researcher. YES. Eliezer goes to a party, continues to talk at an attractive woman about AI and alignment even after she says \"please leave, you're making me feel uncomfortable,\" that's a NO, because Eliezer is not an organization representing 20 or more people (but I do believe that being aggressively boring at parties can be human rights abuse \ud83e\udd23 ). Hope that clarifies things.\n","[Market title] Will the Effective Altruism Movement experience another major scandal not related to FTX by the end of 2023?\n[Market description] This market resolves \"Yes\" if, by 11:59 p.m. AoE on 31\/12\/2023 at least three Wikipedia-notable publications publish an article about the misbehavior of a major philosophical voice or financial donor of the Effective Altruism Movement that directly relates the purported behavior to the ideals or structure of the Effective Altruism movement (i.e. \"Figure X accused of Embezzlement\" does not count; \"Figure X, sheltered by 'Effective Altruists', accused of Embezzlement,\" does). Reports by minor publications, accusations on Effective Altruism forums, etc. do not count. If no such thing occurs, this market resolves \"No.\"\n\nUPDATE 1 (13-1-2023 @ 10:01 P.M.): There is a Business Insider article that explicitly mentions Bostrom, his relationship to effective altruism, and the email scandal. Insofar as I can tell, this is the closest thing to an article about the scandal as it exists now that ties it to Effective Altruism. I am inclined to count this as one in favor of the requisite three, but am open to more discussion on this in the comments.\n UPDATE 2 (17-1-2023 @ 7:54 A.M.): Discourse in the comments leaves me inclined to not count the above-linked article.\n\nUPDATE 3 (20-1-2023 @ 9:57 A.M.): See the status of particular articles here. When three distinct articles on the same topic get a \"Yes,\" that's what this market will resolve to. If the movement makes it the rest of the year without such an event, this market resolves \"NO.\" This is not a change in the stipulations I laid out above, but rather a more effective and public way of tracking it than the analog method that I was probably going to end up using.

If I allowed for that, Torres (or anyone else for that matter) could just take one small incident and write a bunch of articles about it.

A scandal is some sort of misbehavior deemed morally wrong that results in public outrage. The way I have tried to measure this is by using Wikipedia-notable publications. I think that Bostrom's email clears the bar for scandal, the thing is that it has not been definitely linked to Effective Altruism by three publications. Admittedly, I could revise that, but I will grant that you may be right in that I should not count initial hit pieces as part of the three used to measure \"scandal\" (and there are some things that may not be reported on by major news sources that could constitute scandal; EA is not the center of the universe after all, so that marks a major limitation of this market's measuring stick, in my opinion). However, given the fact that Bostrom revealed this prior to Torres, I will count it, as the prior revelation was factored into the Truthdig article, meaning that it still constitutes a reaction to Bostrom's more recent behavior and is more than the original hit piece would have been.\n---\n[Date]: 01-25-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  \"makes one worry about the whole Bostrom-adjacent thoughtspace.\" Honestly I am having a tough time with this one.

The Jacobin article did the same. In those senses, they were about Bostrom and how his racism is a problem for or revealing of EA values. The Business Insider Article seems to sort of be along the lines of what you were describing, but it wasn't really \"about\" Bostrom, the email, or his connections to EA.

There could be a question, then, if scandals in subsets of movements could be enough for the whole movement to be in scandal (i.e. scandals involving Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists embroiling the entire modern feminist movement in scandal). It would be incumbent on showing that Longtermism is indeed a proper subset of Effective Altruism (it can't exist outside of it) and that scandals involving Longtermists should be considered scandals for the whole Effective Altruism movement.

Feel free to ask about hypothetical scenarios and I'll answer how I'd judge them. I'll add clarifications to this description as they're worked out.\n\n\"A leader in EA\" refers to anyone who has significant influence\/social status within the EA community or has the power to move large quantities of EA-allocated funds. Heads of EA organizations, writers of EA-aligned books, grantmakers, etc. I'll be fairly liberal with this definition; I'll lean towards more people being \"leaders\" rather than fewer. (It does not include SBF or anyone else who could be considered FTX\/Alameda leadership.)\n\nThe \"unethical behavior\" in question must have been related to fraudulent investiment strategies that involve spending other people's money without their permission. If SBF engaged in unrelated unethical behavior, such as walking past a child drowning in a pond or illegally harvesting organs, that doesn't count for this market.\n\n\"Cover up\" refers to knowing about the unethical behavior and chosing to keep that knowledge private. There doesn't have to have been any particular action taken; inaction is morally equivalent to action, after all. Some clarifications:\n\nThe EA leader in question must have assigned a decent probability to fraud\/theft occurring. It it seems that they had enough evidence to conclude there was fraud happening, but naivety\/motiviated reasoning prevented them from realizing it, that does not count as a \"cover up\". (I won't be too generous with this; if it seems like any reasonable person would have known, yet they still profess innocence, I'll count that as a cover-up.)\n\nIf they were afraid of retaliation and didn't publicize their concerns out of fear for themselves, that still counts as a cover-up. Any charitable organization where whisleblowers are discouraged that strongly has a serious problem.\n\nIf they only found out about the fraud after signing an NDA and couldn't legally say anything about it, that does not count as a cover-up on their part. (It would certainly be a cover-up from FTX, but we already know that happened.) After all, the whole point of this scandal is that we don't want EAs breaking laws just to do what they personally think is right.\n\nIf actions were taken to maintain plausible deniability, or it otherwise seems like they were trying to \"avoid finding out\" about the fraud, that still counts as a cover up. Bayes cannot be fooled by such games.\n\nMarket resolves YES if at least one EA leader satisfies these criteria. Multiple \"leaders\" is not a necessity.\n\nI will not be placing any trades in this market. I will discuss my intended resolution with the community here before actually resolving it, to ensure people feel my resolution is reasonable.\n\nIf anyone wants to submit information completely anonymously, you can do so here.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 11-12-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-18-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Agreed that \"never heard of her\" doesn't mean all that much, especially considering how little I'm involved in the EA community.

While none of the public evidence seems conclusive, the fact that we have people saying things in an EA leadership Slack channel like: certainly seems to imply that somebody could have had reasonable suspicion of serious fraud. What we should be considering is not the evidence that has been made public, but all evidence that exists. The fact that nothing completely damning has come to light implies that it doesn't exist, since if it did exist, it would be more likely to be shared by someone than the wishy washy borderline evidence we're debating here. However, the existence of this amount of borderline evidence tells me there's probably a lot more where that came from, and the only reason we don't know about it was that it was in more private locations. If we  look at the trend line and update to the end , it certainly looks to me like there's a greater than 16% chance somebody had enough data to make the connections and have strong suspicions that a significant fraction of FTX\/Alameda was built on fraud.\n---\n[Date]: 02-09-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:    My intention is that the EA leader must have had a strong suspicion of the actual large financial crime that occurred. Other crimes are useful evidence towards that; if I see someone break a bunch of regulation laws, maybe defraud someone in an unrelated business, it would certainly increase my credence that they're defrauding people in their main business. Does that answer your questions, or am I misunderstanding? Also regarding my inactivity in this market, it was a bit of both.

(The issue could be that what I consider reasonable is more broad than what most people consider reasonable.) I suspect I'm caught in an impossible conundrum.

I'm not comfortable assuming that just because person A spent time with person B, person B must know the same things that person A knows. (It depends on how much time of course, and what the relationship was like. I don't know much about the organizational structure at CEA, but there's a huge difference between \"friends who see each other every day and hang out in their off time\" vs. \"co-workers who happen to work in the same building\".) Even then, I don't think I would look at someone who legally-but-scummily took control of a company from their acquaintances and think to myself \"yeah that guy is probably going to steal money from his customers\". Though I could see myself being convinced differently on this one.\n---\n[Date]: 11-19-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:   This is reasonable.

Various EAs knew Sam on a personal level and may have heard rumors, but I haven't heard anything about any EAs trying to do a serious investigation of FTX. Why would they? SBF presented themselves as someone who wanted to do good and was willing to sacrifice personal comfort for that cause. If that image were accurate, there'd be no particular reason for someone to look deeper. Yeah, well that's the crux. Just being known to some people somewhere is not good enough. It would have to be all the information known to a single person before you could start having a reasonable suspicion. Why not? Obviously hindsight bias is a big problem here, but putting all 5 of my points together certainly seems pretty suggestive. I wonder if we could run an experiment on this to eliminate the effects of hindsight bias? Find some EA who's been living under a rock, tell them some of the rumors that have been floating around about SBF without telling them about the whole FTX scandal, and ask for their conclusions.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Reposting this from a comment below as it's the most comprehensive summary I've seen so far: https:\/\/thezvi.substack.com\/p\/sadly-ftx\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: https:\/\/forum.effectivealtruism.org\/posts\/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7\/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective?commentId=Z8xp59GK4EwnAni4X\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: \n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That seems unfair to the YES bettors, and isn't in line with my past communication. To give a specific example, say we find out that a single EA leader knew about all of the following pieces of information: In that case I think it would be hard to convince me that that person didn't have a reasonable suspicion of what was going on. Such a revelation would likely result in this market resolving YES, even though it's not  direct  knowledge of the fraud, and there could still be reasonable doubt.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Why is that your expectation?

Fundamentally, I think the question people want to know is \"did EA leadership do anything wrong\". Clearly, something bad happened at FTX, something that we would have preferred to not happen. Uncharitably, people are looking for who they can blame. More charitably, people are trying to figure out what norms and structures in EA contributed to this scandal and what needs to change in order to prevent something similar from happening again. The relevant norm here is about how to balance transparency and honesty vs. reputation and PR. Both are obviously important, and figuring out the exact balance is not easy. (Arguably this is one of the main differences between the rationalist movement and the EA movement. Rationalism is more about clear communication and avoiding deception, whereas EA is more about taking the actions that are actually effective at bettering the world. Due to the way human society works, misleading people and hiding information are often effective.) The question is whether the focus on reputation went too far and actually led to a  worse  outcome for EA's goals. There may also be some concerns that EA leadership was personally benefitting from SBF's donations, and may have put selfish gain above what was best for EA on expectation. (From what I've seen, these latter concerns are less prevalent.) Taking all that into account, what this market is trying to ask is some combination of these questions: Those are much more complicated questions than can be resolved by a single YES\/NO market. So I tried to boil it down to \"was a decision made to keep information private, where sharing that information could have prevented or mitigated this scandal, and that should reasonably have been known at the time?\". A useful test might be to consider what I would have done in their position. Personally, I have an ingrained distaste for reputational considerations, and I usually just say what I think is true and don't worry too much about modeling the consequences. And I'm not sure what I would have done if I had had their knowledge. Many things are best addressed in private, either because it's embarrassing to have them known publicly, or because it's simply not relevant to the public. And, as I have grudgingly had to accept from time to time, pointing out people's flaws in public tends to make them more resistant to changing then if I bring it up in private where they don't feel like their own reputation is being attacked. What are some things that would be damning? Well, if they had any direct knowledge of the fact that FTX was insolvent or that they had transferred customer deposits to Alameda (and knowing enough about finance to know that that's bad), that would be pretty clear cut. Possibly the clearest hint we've actually gotten so far about how bad they actually were with money is the fact that FTX apparently squandered all the profits they made on the Japan arbitrage. But even that doesn't necessarily point towards willingness to commit fraud. It's a big step to go from losing your own money to taking other people's. It would have to be combined with character assessments, and so far while it seems fairly well-accepted that Sam was big on taking risks and a bit more of a jerk than his public persona made him out to be, most risky jerks still don't commit crimes. There's also the fact that judging by his text messages with Kelsey Piper, he doesn't think he actually stole anything, he was just incredibly disorganized and\/or thought it was acceptable for financial institutions to do these sorts of things. A character assessment of \"naive and likely to lose money entrusted to him\" should also have set off alarm bells among EA leadership. (Regardless of whether or not that's the true explanation for his actions.) I give these examples so you have an idea of how I'm thinking about the behavior of EA leaders and about what this market is trying to measure. I know many other accusations have been levied, and I'm not trying to write up a comprehensive response to all of them. I just want to be as clear as possible about my internal process, since it's that process that's ultimately going to be deciding this market. I'm going to stick as closely as possible to the criteria that are currently in the description. (Or, if further discussion ensues and those criteria end up changing, whatever new criteria we end up with.) For any areas where those written criteria are ambiguous, hopefully I've given you some insight into how future information might change this market's resolution probability. I will continue answering questions and trying to arrive at as clear a set of resolution criteria as we reasonably can. Ideally any further necessary discussion and clarifications will occur  before  all the remaining information about SBF comes out, since it'll be a lot easier to get everyone to agree on things when those agreements don't come with an immediate consequence of one person losing mana. Resolving disagreements will be more of a challenge once both sides are searching for post hoc justifications for why this market should resolve in their favor.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: For clarity for anyone reading this comment on Manifold, that whole second paragraph was also supposed to be part of the quote from Oliver Habryka.\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Oh, two more things:\n---\n[Date]: 11-18-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Given all the concerns about resolution ambiguity, I've decided to not place any more bets in this market.

I'm working on more clarifications, but this is an extremely vague and subjective topic, and it's not going to be possible to specify everything to technical precision.

The primary bad behaviors being discussed happened several years ago, and there was time for that information to percolate outwards and for people to leave their original positions and be more comfortable talking poorly about former associates. The current scandal is still extremely recent, and people right now are going to be in full \"damage control\" mode.

I'm open to suggestions, but I think it's reasonable to resolve YES there (assuming that it happens after Biden is the democratic nominee). Another option is to resolve PROB, based on a reasonable estimate of how many people who read the vote Biden instead of a 3rd party.

However, in 2024 the map of seats up for reelection suggests that Republicans will regain control, and future election maps potentially indicate the same through 2030. \n\nWill the Democratic Party control the Senate again before 2030? This would be either a 51-49 majority or a 50-50 split with a Democratic Vice President.  \n\nThis will resolve YES early if the Democratic Party takes control, or resolve NO when the senators are sworn in in 2031 for the 2030 elections and Democrats did not take control any time prior.

Secondly, whether Democrats maintain control of the Senate in the 2022 midterms. Both of these conditions resolve according to the NYT (https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/). \n\nThis resolves to the above criteria even if seat(s) are vacant on a 9-person, functioning Supreme Court. If the court size is changed, the court abolished or it has not sat in more than a year, this question resolves as one of the \"Court size changed or other\" resolutions, based on which party had control in the 2022 midterms. \n\nThe Democrats are considered to have control of the Senate if, after the 2022 midterms, there are 51 or more Senators who caucus with the Democrats (or 50 and a Democratic Vice President). Any other outcome will be considered that they do not have control. Usually, other outcomes would result in Republican control, but a Democratic senator could stop caucusing with the Democrats before the midterm results. This would not lead to Republican control but would not constitute Democratic control either. \n[Market creator] Nathan Young\n[Creation date] 09-26-2022\n[Closing data] 01-20-2025\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] If Democrats have 52 seats in the Senate after the midterms, will the Senate break legislative filibuster?\n[Market description] Resolves positively if:\n\n \u2022 The Democrats have exactly 51 seats after the midterms, else N\/A\n\n\u2022 The U.S. Senate passes a motion to invoke cloture and end debate on any part of the legislative process, with such cloture motion receiving Yea votes from fewer than three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, else NO. \n\nMay 5, 10:12am: Correction to description: 52 seats, not 51.\n\nOct 6, 12:22pm: Formatting\n[Market creator] Tetra\n[Creation date] 05-05-2022\n[Closing data] 11-20-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 11-20-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Resolving N\/A because Democrats have either 50 or 51 seats depending on the results of the Georgia runoff.\n"],"102":["[Market title] Will the Golden State Warriors win Game 6 of the 2023 NBA Western Conference Semifinals vs. the Los Angeles Lakers?\n[Market description] Tipoff is Friday May 12 in Los Angeles.

(I'd allow for ~week of payment processing, etc).

A 300k grant would have represented a significant chunk of our budget, but a loan is something we can make with much less analysis, esp given that we were possibly going to park our ~2.2m cash balance in a high yield treasury account anyways\n\nI didn't think very deeply wrt interest rate; originally offered interest-free, before realizing that we'd be losing out on baseline yield; 1% for 2 months felt roughly reasonable. The core motive was more \"help out an org we think does great work\" as opposed to \"purely profit seeking\".\n\nStephen informs me the market rate for a loan like this might be 15% annualized, in which case I'd view the difference between market rate and what we offered (~2.5% - 1% over 2 months on 300k = 4.5k) to be a donation to Lightcone\n\nConflict of interest notes: Manifold is discussing running a forecasting conference at Rose Garden Inn sometime around Sep 2023; we'd expect to pay for the use of the venue.\n[Market creator] Austin\n[Creation date] 06-23-2023\n[Closing data] 08-19-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-15-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  as mentioned in the description, I would have allowed about a week for payment processing to clear past market close.

This should help explain how to interpret ISW's maps and why ISW is a commonly considered a reliable map source. (This is stuff that has been discussed in a lot of threads before, just summarizing it in one place here.) ISW publishes maps which are updated daily to their interactive map  https:\/\/isw.pub\/InteractiveUkraineWarMap  and their Ukraine conflict updates  https:\/\/www.understandingwar.org\/backgrounder\/ukraine-conflict-updates . ISW assesses control of territory (the red shading) based on visual evidence \/ geolocated footage. As an example, here is a detailed thread by one of the map authors showing how this is done for one day's updates:  https:\/\/twitter.com\/georgewbarros\/status\/1643403932276858880 . Because it moves only after verification based on visual evidence, the red shading is a relatively more conservative and reliable indicator of Russian control compared to the yellow shading and to some other maps, especially in contested areas. It may sometimes tend to lag some days behind other maps, depending on the speed at which visual evidence becomes available. In Bakhmut, advances in the red shading have often been several days behind the yellow shading and other maps. On the other hand, for an example where it updated quickly, after Ukraine retook Kherson, ISW's maps were updated  within a day  because of the plentiful visual evidence available. So when an area becomes shaded red on ISW's maps, it means we can be highly confident that Russia has advanced there, whereas on other maps it may represent a lower level of confidence. This has obvious pros and cons (confidence vs latency of updates), just be aware of it when interpreting the maps. The maps are updated at 3pm ET every day, and the conflict updates are published later that day with the same maps (note that they also say \"Assessed Control ... as of 3:00 PM ET\"). I.e. the historical maps for each day are available in those conflict updates. This is very helpful for using it as a resolution source, compared to other maps which update live and don't necessarily have an easily accessible historical archive.\n---\n[Date]: 04-13-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Another map:  https:\/\/deepstatemap.live\/en#15\/48.5895\/37.9919  currently shows the red line going almost to but not quite covering the train station (this is a different map source, not the resolution source, just providing more info). They had the red zone covering the station briefly but then they moved the red line back a bit in an update half a day later.\n---\n[Date]: 04-13-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Right now, control appears to be contested, based on multiple sources. Regardless, the question resolves solely based on ISW, who is a reputable and reliable source based on my knowledge.

It has pros and cons, makes the question hinge less on map updates that might be based on not much data, but on the other hand it can be a bit of a pain to check whether it hit the resolution criteria or not when there's really a lot of back-and-forth fighting.\n---\n[Date]: 04-21-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think it's ok, but it's preferable if the resolution criteria maps as closely as possible an intuitive question. For example, in this case the more intuitive statement of the question might be \"Will Russia have clearly established control of the Bakhmut train station by April 20?\" - the \"clearly established\" part helps reflect how ISW does their mapmaking. But I suspect people would prefer to predict a question that doesn't hinge on the \"clearly established\" part (which could be easily done by using the orange shaded region, or using a different map). Then the question is more like, \"Will Russia appear to have control of the train station?\" But do note that such a question could also have come down to the wire, and seen lots of disagreements between different maps, if the deadline was about a week earlier.  That's an option but I'm not a fan of that, I'd rather just ask whether ISW will shade the location either red or orange.\n---\n[Date]: 04-21-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I'm planning to create some more markets similar to this.

This should help explain how to interpret ISW's maps and why ISW is a commonly considered a reliable map source. (This is stuff that has been discussed in a lot of threads before, just summarizing it in one place here.) ISW publishes maps which are updated daily to their interactive map  https:\/\/isw.pub\/InteractiveUkraineWarMap  and their Ukraine conflict updates  https:\/\/www.understandingwar.org\/backgrounder\/ukraine-conflict-updates . ISW assesses control of territory (the red shading) based on visual evidence \/ geolocated footage. As an example, here is a detailed thread by one of the map authors showing how this is done for one day's updates:  https:\/\/twitter.com\/georgewbarros\/status\/1643403932276858880 . Because it moves only after verification based on visual evidence, the red shading is a relatively more conservative and reliable indicator of Russian control compared to the yellow shading and to some other maps, especially in contested areas. It may sometimes tend to lag some days behind other maps, depending on the speed at which visual evidence becomes available. In Bakhmut, advances in the red shading have often been several days behind the yellow shading and other maps. On the other hand, for an example where it updated quickly, after Ukraine retook Kherson, ISW's maps were updated  within a day  because of the plentiful visual evidence available. So when an area becomes shaded red on ISW's maps, it means we can be highly confident that Russia has advanced there, whereas on other maps it may represent a lower level of confidence. This has obvious pros and cons (confidence vs latency of updates), just be aware of it when interpreting the maps. The maps are updated at 3pm ET every day, and the conflict updates are published later that day with the same maps (note that they also say \"Assessed Control ... as of 3:00 PM ET\"). I.e. the historical maps for each day are available in those conflict updates. This is very helpful for using it as a resolution source, compared to other maps which update live and don't necessarily have an easily accessible historical archive.\n---\n[Date]: 04-15-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  You are correct, ISW is updating the maps every day.

In total 6 points (1 per every month since Dec 2022) were given to all 20 people mentioned in this market, and the number of those points has to fall to 0, before the streak is broken and reset to 0. So the wait time between somebody becoming inactive on Manifold and this market resolving will currently be at most 6 days. The core problem here is that those points accumulate. So, in theory, some of the people in this market might end up with 13 forgiveness points on Jan 1st 2024, and then take a ~2 week break from Manifold, and their streak will still be unbroken when they return. This logic feels wrong. Such a long break no longer feels   as streak. So I might advocate for capping forgiveness points to 3, in the  #dev-and-api  channel on Discord.

When a range is offered, the midpoint of the range will be taken. If there is no easy way to determine which Ukraine casualties happened in 2022 vs. 2023, the current total of 225,216 will be subtracted from the best available end-of-2023 number. The casualty numbers for other wars will be calculated in a method as similar to this as possible; if an identical methodology cannot be used, we reserve the right to use credible third-party (eg US government, well-known neutral media outlet) estimates.\n\nThis is question #13 in the Astral Codex Ten 2023 Prediction Contest.

Regardless of the outcome of the immediate media campaign and potential internal conflict, will Wagner Group and Russia eventually re-establish friendly ties and resume the invasion of Ukraine together by the end of 2023?\n\nThis market makes no distinction between whether Wagner is a de facto Russian government organization or not. An assumption this market is making is that there is a possibility of conflict between the two, even if they're otherwise one-and-the-same, but whether conflict actually arises or not doesn't affect the resolution of this market.\n\nPerhaps the recent news is a ruse to squash the pretty well-substantiated rumors that Wagner Group is simply another arm of Russia's military. Or it's a feint to allow a coordinated surprise push. I'm sure most of us are hoping it devolves into a destabilization of Russia's invasion, but even if it does will it be a lasting split or will they make peace with each other in favor of resuming their campaign against Ukraine?\n\n---\n\nUpdate to include some clarifications that you might find useful:\n\nThis is about the organization, not the individuals. Former-Wagner troops dont count, but Wagner-branded units do.\n\nWe're mostly looking for active deployment into battlefields.

I could have elaborated more on how i just wanted to confirm\/disprove the rumours of the moment, but i feel like the title \"...right now\", and the first sentence \"Rumors are going round that...\" showed that already. ======   resolution criteria and discussion ======   I initially specified the following resolution criteria: \"Resolves early if there is widespread media consensus for either side.\" \"Otherwise resolves according to my gut feeling about this having been a coup or a false alarm.\" I also changed the definition of \"coup\" a bit by using the phrase: \"...Wagner units are attempting a coup against the russian ministry of defense.\" As this market got more and more attention there was a lot of discussion about the specifics which promted me to expand further on what i thought constitutes a coup: \"I'd define coup as an armed insurgency aimed to replace any higher official, including the Minister of Defence.\" \"I think what is going on could reasonably be described as a coup insofar as it involves a military organization turning on its own to remove a person in power.\" \"as for specifying the resolution criteria: I think if I see enough combat footage of Wagnerites fighting Russian forces I will be satisfied.\" My initial motivation was to get an answer to the question \"Are the russians really fighting against each other or is this just a rumour that will turn out not to be a big deal?\". Since this affair made world-news for several days and there was extensive footage ( https:\/\/www.oryxspioenkop.com\/2023\/06\/chefs-special-documenting-equipment.html ) this question has been answered as a resounding YES. I felt quite confident with that until the wagnerites stopped 300km south of Moscow the next day. At this point the discussion started to revolve around the question wether \"a coup that hasn't happened\" could still be counted as a coup. To this i didn't have an intuitive answer, so i promised to not resolve the market early. But i still want to look at what the media has to say. ======  Media-consensus ======   In order to assess the this i searched for news articles to see what they called the Event. Here are articles that at some point called it a \"coup\": Guardian: \"The Wagner uprising: 24 hours that shook Russia\" \"Prigozhin\u2019s breezy coup attempt, or march for justice as he meekly put it, was real.\" https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jun\/25\/prigozhins-march-on-moscow-chronology-of-an-attempted-coup Kyiv Post \"Prigozhin's coup attempt was a \"black swan\" event that put Moscow on edge and could be the beginning of Putin's end.\u00a0\" https:\/\/www.kyivpost.com\/videos\/18905 Here are some articles explaining that it actually wasn't a coup. William Partlett from the university of Melbourne wrote \"Why Prigozhin\u2019s march on Moscow was not a coup\". I found that article interesting to read because of the \"dual-state\"-thing but in the end Partlett's analysis hinges on the fact that Prigozhin propably didn't want to bring down the regime of Putin and we already assessed that point. https:\/\/pursuit.unimelb.edu.au\/articles\/why-prigozhin-s-march-on-moscow-was-not-a-coup The New Yorker wrote in \"What Prigozhin\u2019s Half-Baked \u201cCoup\u201d Could Mean for Putin\u2019s Rule\" https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/q-and-a\/what-prigozhins-half-baked-coup-could-mean-for-putins-rule that \"this was not an attempt to conduct a coup. It was a gesture of desperation.\", which also doesn't bring us much further because why wouldn't a coup happen out of desparation? The Guardian -despite earlier calling it a coup-attempt- calls it \"less an attempted coup, more an impulsive demonstration that got out of hand\". https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jun\/30\/could-yevgeny-prigozhin-really-have-captured-moscow-wagner-russia Some call it something else: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/06\/26\/wager-coup-putins-regime-looks-deeply-damaged-despite-failure-of-coup.html \"so-called 24 hour coup\", or \"rebellion\". Some only quote people calling it a coup: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/2023\/06\/23\/world\/russia-ukraine-news All in all i think that there isn't a real consensus. Especially not if you take into account that our definition of a coup (coups can target the ministry of defence) is a bit different than the official one.  So how to decide?  Gut-feeling: Yes Media consensus: N\/A, or No ====== Political Science to the rescue! ======  The Wikipedia article on \"coup d'etat\" links to an article in the \"Journal of Peace Research\" from 2011, written by Clayton Thyne and Jonathan Powell from the University of Kentucky. They looked at 14 studies on coups from 1950 to 2010 and worked out a definition of what constitutes a coup. Just what we need! https:\/\/www.uky.edu\/~clthyn2\/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf They define a coup by five criteria. Here is a short summary of the interesting parts with my comments after the bullet points: Targets: The first factor in arriving at a definition is in deciding who may be targeted. We remain consistent with previous research by considering only attempts to overthrow the chief executive. Perpetrators: Coups may be undertaken by any elite who is part of the state apparatus. These can include non-civilian members of the military and security services, or civilian members of government Tactics: Two factors must be considered [...]: First, the activity must be illegal.  Second, a near-universal criterion for coups is that violence does not have to be present. Plots and rumors: [We opt to] coding only cases where coup attempts were \u2018overt\u2019 (there has been a visible movement to claim power) and \u2018actual\u2019 (the events are not alleged ex post facto in some kind of trial proceeding). Success and failure: We [...] differentiate between failed and successful efforts. A coup attempt is [...] defined as successful if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven days. =====Summary and Conclusion==== It could be possible for the naysayers to find another, slightly different definition of \"coup\" and start a discussion again. After all this is political science, so there are propably multiple schools of thought fighting each other. But all i could find was this paper here: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1BndbowTxB245Hc3hOOWdYisBJpULcKM9\/view?pli=1 ... wich contains a nice flowchart (Figure 2: Coding Rules), but makes the grave error of requiring the perpetrators to seek power. I think it is nigh impossible to asses the true intentions of an honest person, let alone the ones of a political figure. This sounds like a recipe for endless unproductive debate and i have a market to resolve so you can get your fake internet points back. So I'll stop this here and now. The resolution criteria stated that i should go by my gut feeling which i do. I hope i was able to explain my thought process a bit and thank you all for engaging in my market.

But spinoffs would not count, e.g. if Amazon spins off AWS, we would not add the value of the two surviving companies.\n\nThis question is not asking if today's top five will collectively be 21.0% of the market, just if the top five will have that share.\n[Market creator] Byrne Hobart\n[Creation date] 04-30-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2025\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-07-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  At the beginning of 2025. i.e. first trading day\n---\n[Date]: 05-01-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  20.95% or above will qualify, as the question text uses 21.0% rather than the rounded number. \n","[Market title] Will at least two new companies enter the top 10 list of publicly traded US companies by the end of June, 2023?\n[Market description] As of today, https:\/\/companiesmarketcap.com\/ lists Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, UnitedHealth, Johnson & Johnson, Visa, and Exxon Mobil  as having the largest market capitalization of the publically traded US companies.

This market resolves to the 10% (rounded up) of proposed names that we like the best. Proposed answers that are not names will not be considered.\n\nClose spelling variations that do not change pronunciation (in my opinion) will only be considered once, with preference given to the first-submitted option. (Consider an example where there are 25 options submitted, including Aiden, Aden, Aidan, Michael, Mikhail and 20 others. Aiden, Aden and Aidan count once, while Michael and Mikhail are pronounced differently so they count separately. That leaves 23 names considered, of which we will choose 3 names to resolve to (10%, 2.3, rounded up to 3).)\n\n\nSome factors that might influence our decision:\n\n-An ultrasound on week 20 identified the baby as a boy, and we are planning to choose a name that is either gender-neutral or typically given to boys.\n\n-We are moderately contrarian--we are less likely to choose an extremely common name, but we do not plan on inventing a new name.\n-Names shared by nerds\/scientists\/astronauts\/etc are more likely to be chosen than names shared by sportsballers\/politicians\/actors\/etc. \n\n-Our heritage is American, Canadian, German and Scottish, and we are more likely to choose a name linked to one of those cultures.\n-We are open to considering arguments in the comments challenging any of the above.\n\n-I have promised to choose a name that my mother will be able to pronounce.\n\nI will not vote in this market, aside from the mana already placed on the \"Cornelius\" answer. I commit to not selling that position, and I commit to not resolving to that answer. That mana is a subsidy provided to the market, since there does not seem to be a \"subsidize\" button for free response markets as there is for yes\/no markets.\n\nClose date updated to 2023-02-13 11:59 pm\n[Market creator] Cornelius Grass\n[Creation date] 01-18-2023\n[Closing data] 02-14-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 02-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: 64 total names, thank you everyone! 10% rounded up is 7 names: Nicholas, Elliott, Finlay, Finn, Theodore, Luther and Valen.\n---\n[Date]: 02-14-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Now that those are out, that seems like it might make sense, but the timing didn't quite work.

My prediction for the market: On the first few days, trading will be a little bit chaotic and there will be some arbitrage opportunities. A few days will pass. In this time period, your ideal strategy would be to buy shares of one option if it strays significantly below 33%, then sell when the option rises to about 33%. Thus, I think the market will settle into a near-equilibrium. Then, the market on the last day will return to chaos. Let's say you have a large volume of Option A shares, and A\/B\/C is at 34\/33\/33%. Now, your optimal strategy would probably be to put a little bit of money in B and C or sell some A shares in order to make A the lowest option. I am very curious to see how the market resolves and if anyone has come up with an interesting strategy.\n"],"124":["[Market title] When will SBF be extradited to the US?\n[Market description] Resolution to:\n\n100% if SBF are extradited and physically arrives US before Dec 20th, 2022\n80% if SBF are extradited and physically arrives US before Dec 31th, 2022\n\n60% if SBF are extradited and physically arrives US before Jan 31th, 2023\n\n40% if SBF are extradited and physically arrives US before Feb 31th, 2023\n\n20% if SBF are extradited and physically arrives US before Mar 31th, 2023\n\n0% if SBF are not extradited and physically arrives US before Apr 31th, 2023\n[Market creator] Ammon Lam\n[Creation date] 12-13-2022\n[Closing data] 12-23-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-13-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: https:\/\/manifold.markets\/AmmonLam\/when-will-sbf-be-extradited-to-the-ea467bf3233d\n","[Market title] Will My BFF Noris Pass His A-Levels with flying colors?\n[Market description] My fellow Noris has been studying the books for many moons, will his efforts prevail or will McDonalds receive a talented new worker?

AFAICT the paper doesn't directly state the scale of the models, although it suggests it's in the 1-10B parameters range.

If it does, I'll do my best to gather input and hew to the spirit of the prediction. I'm betting in this market myself and promise to be transparent about my reasoning in the comments. AMA!\n\nFAQ\n\n1. Does the photo have to be undetectable as AI-generated?\n\nNo, if the photo is perfectly believable on casual inspection but can be determined to be AI-generated with some forensics, that still counts as YES. \n\nOf course detecting that the image is fake via real-world knowledge -- like knowing things about the human test subjects or just knowing that the depicted scene is fantastical -- isn't grounds for resolving NO.\n\n2. How well does it have to understand the text descriptions?\n\nMuch better than 2022 DALL-E but it doesn't have to be quite human-level. If you have to work to find convoluted descriptions that confuse it, that still counts as YES. If there are perfectly clear descriptions that you can't get it to understand even with multiple rephrasings, that's a NO.\n\n3. Does it have to be able to generate deepfakes of anyone?\n\nYes, if it can only do public figures or any fixed database of people, that doesn't count. To resolve YES it needs to work for anyone you provide sample images of. Even people who do not exist.\n\n4. Does it have to be available to anyone?\n\nYes, if OpenAI or Google or such demonstrate the ability but there's no reasonable way for outsiders to try it, this resolves NO. This matters because the question isn't just about the cutting edge of the technology but also how impactful\/dangerous it will be.\n\nAnd we're using $100 as the threshold for how much time\/cost it can take for an outsider to get an image like this generated and still count as \"available to anyone\".\n\n5. Any constraints on the sample images?\n\nIf it required a massive number of sample images or the sample images had to be taken with special equipment, like doing a 3D body or face scan or something, that starts to go outside the spirit of the question. But of course it's fine for the AI to make up any details about the subjects that are impossible to tell from the sample images. \n\nThe rule of thumb is that someone judging the deepfake, who only knows the subjects from the same sample images the AI saw, would not be immediately suspicious that the generated image was fake. (Unless the image was depicting something fantastical. You get the idea.)\n\n6. How instant does it have to be?\n\nOne hour. The \"instant\" in the title is more about being on-demand and fully automated than about exactly how long the image takes to generate.\n\n7. Does it have to nail it on the first try?\n\nNo, as William Ehlhardt points out, there's a beyond-astronomical space of possible images so the ability to generate, say, one in a hundred that match the prompt isn't very much less gobsmacking than the ability to do it on the first try. The AI is still meaningfully succeeding at the task. We'll go with best-of-ten when resolving this market.\n\n8. Does it have to be able to do NSFW photos?\n\nNo, if it has filters that prevent it from generating reasonably narrow\/specific categories of images such as NSFW, that doesn't prevent this from resolving YES. PS: I forgot that a year ago in the comments here I'd already clarified this thusly: Applying normal content filtering is fine as long as it isn't somehow so broad that it covers up an inability to handle arbitrary descriptions.\n\nAI Bulls vs AI Bears\n\nThis market is another possible operationalization of the disagreement between what I'll call the AI Bulls and the AI Bears. The bulls believe, for example, that \"scale is all you need\". That we're on a trajectory towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and that it will emerge automatically by scaling up existing neural net architectures. If you believe that it's scale plus a handful of additional breakthroughs that the time is ripe for, that still puts you pretty far towards the bull end of the bear-bull spectrum. The AI bears, such as Gary Marcus, believe that recent leaps in capability and seeming-understanding shown by DALL-E and GPT and the like are going to hit another wall before reaching human level and that AGI is thus still decades away.\n\nNote that the bear-bull spectrum is orthogonal to the spectrum of beliefs about how hard AI alignment is. For example, an AI bear may agree that if we did somehow hit upon AGI in a few years, that would literally destroy humanity. Likewise, some AI bulls believe that AI doom is nigh and others believe that AI utopia is nigh.\n\nRelated Markets\n\nSame prediction but by end of 2024\n\nWhether DALLE-3 will be able to do \"blue grass, green sky\"\n\nAnother DALLE-3 \"blue grass, green sky\" market (maybe with stricter criteria?)\n[Market creator] Daniel Reeves\n[Creation date] 12-07-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2028\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-20-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I got an interesting comment on this offline, saying that for the deepfake aspect -- as in generating novel images that look like real photos of a specific person -- we're basically there with 10-15 sample images and a LoRA. We're much less close on \"synthesize basically any image\" part. Also inpainting makes a huge difference. Which has me thinking that we should clarify whether any back-and-forth is allowed with the human who's specifying the image. Do you have to feed the system the sample images and the prompt and take the best of what it gives you in one shot? Or can you guide it with some back-and-forth, either with words or by indicating specific parts of the image that need to change? By default I think it has to be fully automated and one-shot but if anyone feels that's overly strict, let's discuss! There may be clarifications we can add to allow for flexibility on this without violating the existing clarifications.\n---\n[Date]: 11-15-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Great clarification.

I think we can factor out the need for reference photos of artifacts by dropping the head-to-head comparison. So we need to feed that description to the image generator, then show only the deepfake to people and ask them if it's a real photo of the described scenario. If most people say it's real or even that they can't tell for sure if it's real, that's a YES. We can stipulate that we pose the question in such a way that when the photo really is real, everyone agrees about it at least being not-obviously-fake. PS: We can disqualify people, for example, for knowing better what a Tour de France bike looks like than a lay person, or we can let the \"most people\" clause cover that. But this is just the original stipulation that it doesn't count to identify the deepfake based on special knowledge.\n---\n[Date]: 08-19-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Are we agreed that for this to resolve YES, we'll need to be able to put together a ridiculous scene like the following, both for real and as a deepfake, generated only from this description, and then show them to people and have it not be obvious which version is the real one? \"Me and Ryan Gosling staring lovingly into each other's eyes.

Let me add a note to the description to say that I'm doing everything I can to make the resolution criteria as objective as they can be but also that I'm trading in the market myself. From what I've gleaned from all the debates about the norms around creators trading in their own markets, the founders don't want to discourage it because often the creator is the person who cares most about the question or has the most information to help the market price converge to the truth. Those are the norms I personally favor: even insider trading is explicitly a good thing because it promotes greater accuracy of the markets. (or maybe most saliently: discouraging creators from trading would mean fewer markets created. and\/or might encourage sockpuppetry?) In any case, please do ask more clarifying questions you can think of. I think the ones we have so far make it reasonably unlikely that we'll find ourselves in a confusing gray area at the end of 2027. But if we do, I promise to do my best to gather input and resolve as close to the spirit of the prediction as possible. I'm also happy to be totally transparent about my own thinking when betting NO on this. Right now it's based on seeing how clueless the state-of-the-art image generators are at composing different aspects of prompts with more than a couple elements to them. (Search \"basketball\" in the comments below for an example.)\n---\n[Date]: 05-16-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:    Well this is getting exciting. To reiterate from other comments, current DALL-E and Midjourney really fall on their faces trying to compose even a few different elements. And consider some other hurdles from the FAQ in the market description here: It all sounds like a lot to me! Of course all of the above is not as gobsmacking as what diffusion models suddenly became capable of in the last couple years. So I'm definitely prepared to be surprised here.\n---\n[Date]: 05-04-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Thanks for the link! Sounds like this is progressing apace. But I think there are multiple hurdles that will take some time. For example, what do you get if you ask for the pope wearing a white puffer jacket sitting on a basketball and holding a melty ice cream cone? I'm guessing it doesn't understand how to compose those different things? (Midjourney and DALL-E don't.)\n---\n[Date]: 04-30-2023\n[Likes] 5\n[Text]: I've  showcased  this market because:\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2022\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  Sounds fair!\n---\n[Date]: 12-11-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Affirmative, applying normal content filtering is fine as long as it isn't somehow so broad that it covers up an inability to handle arbitrary descriptions. For defining \"instant\" (thanks again for identifying these ambiguities!) I wouldn't feel great about resolving NO if this worked fine but took a few minutes to generate. So I propose a 1-hour threshold as still counting as relatively instant. What I really meant by instant was on-demand, fully automated, not so much about the exact amount of time it takes. But holler if you already bet based on a stricter interpretation and we can find a fair compromise. Not that it's very likely to come down to that!\n---\n[Date]: 12-10-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Oh man, another great question. Any objections to setting a $100 threshold on how cheap\/easy it has to be for an outsider to get such an image generated?

After expending so much effort to get Congress to formally endorse such visits to Taiwan, this is a dramatic change of tone from Taipei. Xi Jinping has, as of yesterday, shed all of the people holding him back from taking extremely bold actions. Yesterday's announcement of the brokered detente between the Saudis and Iranians was a geopolitical coup. Taiwan may actually be in play before the next US presidential election. I think I am changing my mind on a lot of things related to China after watching Xi at the most recent \"two sessions\" meeting. He had swagger. He was casually sipping tea while engaging in small talk with Wang Huning and Li Qiang. It's just - different.

Just politically speaking Nancy did it and the CCP was triggered hilariously so now every Speaker will do it for the foreseeable future or risk their party looking weaker than Nancy (they still are regardless) and the CCP looking like their flexing during her visit somehow influenced our support of Taiwan (it very much did not). Plus McCarthy was butt hurt Nancy didn't invite him and he has already promised not only to visit himself, but he wants to bring dozens of members of both parties with him.  Personally I think Apple should just buy TSMC and then the whole idea of who Taiwan belongs to is settled, it would be Tim Cook\u2019s.

(Sponsored by Wobbles)\n[Market description] This will be the central location for tournament info. See also the #mtg-tournaments channel in the Manifold Discord server. All markets about this tournament can go into the February MTG tournament group.\n\nWe have 16 competitors. We're going to be running this as a traditional Swiss tournament of 5 rounds, followed by a cut to top 4 single elimination. The prize payout is:\n\n1st place: M$2000\n\n2nd place: M$1400\n\n3rd and 4th place: M$650 each\n\n5th through 8th place: M$100 each\n\nYour deck must be one of the 15 provided intro decks. (5 monocolor and 10 bicolor.) Please make sure you're using the Alchemy versions and not the Standard versions. You may swap decks in between rounds, but must use the same deck for all games of a single match. You also can't swap decks in the top 4, so the finals match must be played with the same deck you used in the semifinals.\n\nAll the normal rules about money and match result determination do not apply to this tournament. You can wager on the matches, bribe your opponent, bet against yourself and then concede, etc. The only rule is that you must be honest about what you did afterwards, so we can decide whether this is a good idea for future tournaments. Any wagers\/bribes should occur only in mana, favors, or other items of non-monetary value. No real money.\n\nI strongly recommend that you stream your match in the Manifold discord voice channel, or some other streaming platform. (Discord is very easy to stream to, it's all built in. Just join the voice channel and click the \"go live\" button.) This will let people spectate and place live bets on your games, which is more fun for everyone. Give people a heads up in discord and\/or the market a few hours in advance, so they know when to show up to spectate.\n\nSpectators should not provide gameplay advice to the players during a match, unless both players have indicated that they're ok with that. Players may not stream snipe their opponent. Looking at your opponent's decklist is allowed, even while the game is ongoing. (Decklists can be found here.) Looking up any other strategical information during the match is not allowed. (Looking up rules and card text is fine.) Betting in markets about your own match is allowed, even if seeing the current probability could give you some informantion about your opponent's hand. However, please don't read the comments or any Discord channels that may contain discussion about the match. The match should primarily be your skills and knowledge at play, not those of other people.\n\nNote that we're using the traditional best-of-3 tournament matches, not Arena's default best-of-1. When you go to create a challenge, use the match type selection box in the top right and choose \"Alchemy tournament match\". (Screenshot)\n\nFor simplicity and ease of locating information, please always report your match result on the market that I made about that match outcome, including who won with what score, and what decks both people were playing.\n\nYou can see the current standings and results here.\n[Market creator] Isaac King\n[Creation date] 03-01-2023\n[Closing data] 05-22-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 05-22-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Closing this now to prevent the issue with DPM markets when someone can pour arbitrary mana into the winning option once it's known.\n---\n[Date]: 03-28-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Wizards has apparently made some changes to the default decks that Arena provides.

This means that the liquidity subsidies from all the traders don't have time to actually enter the market, so the market ends up being much less liquid than it should be during the active betting window. I think an easy fix for this is if everyone who plans to watch the match place a M$1 bet in advance, and then the liquidity will be there by the time the match occurs.\n---\n[Date]: 03-15-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Round 2 pairings are available at  https:\/\/challonge.com\/manifoldmtg .

I was dealing with some tough issues in the last few days, but let's keep this project going.

Based on the poll results, I've decided to change the format of the playing card set to include 18 individuals (12 face cards, 4 Aces, and 2 jokers). To ensure that we have 4 female characters for the Queens, I'll make sure to select enough females to fill all of the Queen positions.

It expanded to include South Africa in 2010, becoming BRICS. \n\nThe question of possible further expansions has been raised multiple times over recent years, with many expecting this to be the year when further expansion is agreed. As of July 2023, 22 countries have formally applied to join, while South Africa claims that as many as 40 countries are interested in joining. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/more-than-40-nations-interested-joining-brics-south-africa-2023-07-20\/\n\nThere is no formal process for accession to membership status, although it would require unanimous agreement from the current members. The question of expansion is on the agenda for the Heads of State Summit in August this year. \n\nThe resolution of the question will depend on official BRICS statements made either during or after the event. Countries do not have to become full members immediately, so long as their future membership has been confirmed. Inclusion as observer states, associates or similar will not count. \n\n[link preview]\n[Market creator] Nosaix\n[Creation date] 07-21-2023\n[Closing data] 08-24-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-26-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Two questions for next year https:\/\/manifold.markets\/Nosaix\/how-many-new-brics-member-states-wi https:\/\/manifold.markets\/Nosaix\/how-many-brics-partner-countries-wi\n---\n[Date]: 08-24-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I find it more helpful to compare BRICS to the European Economic Community, in its early days with just 6 founding members. It took 35 years for the EEC to become the EU and 30 more to become the EU we know today.  I doubt that BRICS will end up being like the EU, but I do expect it to grow and evolve over time. With only 5 members, it didn't really need the institutions and binding agreements, but they will start to need them as they grow. It's going to be interesting to see what it does turn into. I think I might ask another question about next year's expansion, while people are paying attention.

Also check out the first ~4 minutes of this video https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mnnYCJNhw7w introducing the project. It's basically a guy trying to show how he can make money off of creative work without intellectual property rights over that work. As of the time this market was created, the Patreon currently has 214 backers and is earning $1,141 per month. At the time of resolution, Studio High Sea will be considered to still exist if it remains at least as successful as it is now and hasn't changed its mission. That means: - The Patreon still has at least 214 patrons and is earning at least $1,141 per month. If it drops below this but climbs back up by the time of resolution, that still counts. If the current Patreon page shuts down and they move to a different studio name or payment platform, the new one is the one that counts. If the payment model changes to something that's not a fixed amount per month, I will try to estimate their earnings in the last month. - The studio's main project is the production of some creative work normally protected by copyright. This could be the current webcomic Airlock Bound or something else. - The main project is released to the public under some license like Creative Commons or Copyleft that essentially waives the creator's copyright and allows other people to do whatever they want with it. This includes anyone being able to monetize derivative works or even plagiarize the original, but not necessarily apply their own copyright to derived works. - The creators do not attempt to control what other people do with their work. Calling someone out on social media is fine, but telling them to stop is not. Attempting a DMCA takedown or lawsuit is definitely not. If there is some weird case where the creators have to sue someone or face legal consequences themselves, an exception can be made. I don't know if such a situation is possible, but if that happens, it doesn't count. This market will resolve YES if all of the above conditions are met, and NO if any condition is clearly broken. Edge cases are open for discussion. If some major unforeseen event happens, like a complete overhaul of the way US copyright law works, this market will resolve N\/A.\n[Market creator] comsynthus\n[Creation date] 03-08-2022\n[Closing data] 03-31-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 03-31-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: As of market close, the Patreon has 124 patrons and $958 per month.

In his lawsuit, Niemann names Magnus Carlsen, Play Magnus, chess.com, Daniel Rensch, and Hikaru Nakamura as defendants. Neimann alleged that the defendants spread false accusations against him regarding cheating and leveraged their positions to unfairly tarnish his reputation.\n\nRules: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Niemann v. Carlsen (E.D. Mo., 4:22-cv-01110) results in Hans Niemann being entitled to any damages from one or more of the named defendants, regardless of the amount awarded to him, by December 31, 2023 at 11:59PM ET. \n\nDamages must (at minimum) exceed the restitution of legal fees. This market can be immediately resolved once a verdict has been reached in Niemann v. Carlsen. \n\nIf no damages have been awarded to Niemass as a result of Niemann v. Carlsen by December 31, 2023 then the market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nIf the case is settled out of court or otherwise dissolved, then the market can also be immediately resolved to \"No\". \n\nAny appeal of the decision in Niemann v. Carlsen will have no bearing on the resolution of this market, and only the initial verdict by the court will be considered. The market will be resolved based on official reporting from the United States District Court or Eastern District of Missouri, or if necessary, a consensus of credible reporting. \n\nLawsuit Excerpt: \"Accordingly, Niemann asserts the following claims against Defendants: (1) slander; (2) libel; (3) unlawful group boycott under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, et. seq.; (4) tortious interference with contract and business expectancies; and (5) civil conspiracy. Niemann seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000).\"\n[Market creator] Tomek K \ud83d\udfe1\n[Creation date] 10-30-2022\n[Closing data] 06-27-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Magnus Carlsen be sanctioned by FIDE in 2022?\n[Market description] Resolves YES if in 2022, Magnus Carlsen is sanctioned by FIDE for any reason; otherwise NO.\n\nBackground\n\nhttps:\/\/worldchess.com\/news\/all\/carlsen-chose-drama-against-niemann-resigned-after-move-2\/\n\nIt comes without saying that after\u00a0Carlsen\u2019s withdrawal\u00a0from the\u00a0Sinquefield Cup 2022, and\u00a0the\u00a0accusations of\u00a0Niemann cheating, the\u00a0chess world was glued to\u00a0their screens for\u00a0their rematch at\u00a0the\u00a0Julius Baer Generation Cup.

That is what many believed was the reason why Magnus did not want to elaborate on his accusations against Niemann during the St.Louis tournament, was because Magnus risked being sanctioned by the World Chess Federation, if he made accusations without evidence. It may have been part of the reason that Magnus didn't make it clear what he meant but, now when he loses a game on purpose, it is behavior that can be sanctioned in the same way as accusing an opponent of cheating.\n\nRelated\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/jack\/did-hans-niemann-cheat-against-magn)\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 09-19-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 01-03-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I believe this is a NO, let me know if I missed anything, otherwise will resolve NO.\n"],"143":["[Market title] Will Greta Gerwigs 'Barbie' have more then 10% disparity between critic\/audience score on Rotten Tomatoes?\n[Market description] Resolves Yes if the difference between critic\/audience score for Greta Gerwigs 'Barbie' is more then 10% in Rotten Tomatoes by 21th of August.

I was not aware of the depth of the 'gamers grinding for elo' culture that existed here, and it took me a bit looking at people's profiles to realize that this website is not  just  for intellectual exploration, but is  also  for competing fiercely. I think the competitive element of the culture here poses risks in markets as they approach 'gambling' territory. gamers, god bless us, are assholes and find a way to be assholes when the stakes are high I think during election season, for instance, there will be tons of new users with markets that, while  clear in intention  and successfully\/accurately resolved, still have the potential to anger some number of power users who feel cheated out of their goals. I do not think this problem is easy to address while still making the website fun and easy-to-access for new users - part of the appeal to me was that I could just jump in and do it!

I respect that Sir Cryptomind is a power user with a good reputation but it\u2019s hard to underscore how much of a horrible experience having a market was because of his and others\u2019 manner of communication. Perhaps if a new user on their first market hits a threshold of popularity on that market, it triggers a review by admins. If the market had 20 participants and 40 trades, light criticisms of the wording would\u2019ve been easier to flesh out, but because the people criticizing me were clearly playing \u201charder\u201d it was difficult to separate out good faith feedback from rage or bitterness. That in turn made it harder for me to provide clarity to the market. In the end I genuinely feel like people sortof hyped themselves up into a frenzy and just ignored my initial description, and expected me to have it all figured out immediately when they asked.

I set up conditions that would allow me to resolve early if there were less reviews than the 'average blockbuster'.  The market ended up continuing after 350 reviews because of the margin (less than 1.2%), and the pace of reviews at 350 being quite substantial. Barbie was a hit - my assumptions and fears about needing conditions to shorten the market were not necessary. By the time we reached 350, the trend had been for reviews to be 90%+ positive for nearly 150 reviews. The market was extremely confident that this trend would continue, as the pace of reviews was declining and it was unlikely to extend very many days forward. After I looked at the data around the pace of additional reviews, and evaluated what a 'slow day' could actually do to impact the RT score, I set up the condition that the market would close if, for two days in a row, less than 15 reviews were added to the total. At around 360, the reviews Fresh% sharply changed, and RT even seemed unsure if previously positive reviews were or were not negative. In the last two days, the pace has slowed to almost no reviews coming in, for the first time since this market launched. For that reason, as well as the streak of +23 fresh reviews and no negative reviews required to even have a chance at budging the current score of 88.94% to 89.95% (which rounds up), I am ready to resolve no.  Secondary markets on whether this 89% will hold indefinitely may be appropriate if RT has a way to add dozens of more reviews long after the initial release window. Thank you for a fun and mildly torturous time, this was my first market and I would do it differently next time by simply setting an RT score, a date, and then muting the discussion.\n---\n[Date]: 07-29-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  love to see a non complainer winning \n---\n[Date]: 07-29-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Yes, the pace of reviews declining combined with the huge net deficit for 90% points to resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 07-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  the arbitrary number emerged as a natural result of me not knowing how many reviews would come in, i can't predict the future the market was not priced all that poorly, imo, it was fair to assume that even in a 'tiebreaker' extention past 350 the existing trends of the previous 350 votes would continue. the fact that the next ~50 reviews were dramatically more negative was legitimately  unexpected . blaming the resolution criteria because an unexpected event happened is not, in my opinion fair. had 400 reviews come in during the first week, the 'margin of closeness' would be different - 5\/6 reviews is 'close' and the pace metrics would be different to. defining all these things is necessarily relative to the pace and quantity of reviews, which I measured consistently in excel throughout the market - and STILL do, today. In other words, I only put numbers to problems when it became clear that I could commit to them with the backing of real-world data such that the purpose of the market - to evaluate the final place the barbie RT score would land - is met.

But as more reviews come in, the quantity required to meaningfully shift whatever the status quo is gets higher and higher.

Resolution will be based on the RT score when the market closes.

The CCP is kinda absurd about titles. President doesn\u2019t automatically mean commander and chief of the military like it does in the US. In fact, the military is specifically under party control and in the case of war it is controlled by regional factional leaders, not central command or joint chiefs who report to Xi. Jiang Zemin maintained control of the military after leaving office and throughout his successor Hu Jintao\u2019s presidency despite being officially retired from political life.  The scariest title Xi could be given is Helmsman IMO.

When the government approaches the debt ceiling, it must either seek an increase in the limit from Congress or take measures to reduce its borrowing.\n\nIn the past, the U.S. has come close to breaching the debt ceiling on several occasions, and in some cases, the government has temporarily suspended the limit or taken other measures to avoid default.\n\nThe US has failed to pay debt obligations on time on several occasions. This Reason article describes five cases which could be characterized as default, and this Congressional Research Service (CRS) report explores three of them in more detail. The most recent occurrence was the 1979 \"mini-default\", when a technical error led to the late payment to holders of Treasury securities. CRS says the following about the overall record of US debt repayment:\n\nThe historical record appears not to support the contention that the U.S. government has had an unblemished payment record since its origin. Under any reasonable definition of default, the federal government defaulted in 1814. The Treasury Secretary of the time, Alexander Dallas, referred to \u201cevery sort of embarrassment.\u201d The current website of the U.S. Treasury notes that Secretary Dallas faced a \u201cbankrupt\u201d Treasury. The failure of the Treasury to pay interest on its securities due to Boston banks in 1814 represents an unambiguous default event.\n\nRegarding the 1979 \"mini-default\" CRS says:\n\nClaims that payment delays to small investors holding Treasury securities in the spring of 1979 constituted a default or a \u201ctechnical default\u201d appear weaker. Delays affected only a relatively small proportion of Treasury securities and the federal government responded to mitigate the inconvenience suffered by those investors. The legal document setting out terms for Treasury securities contained no default clause.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the deadline for a debt ceiling increase could come earlier than expected:\n\nThe U.S. government's deadline to raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling could be sooner than expected, raising the prospect of a short-term debt limit extension, analysts said on Tuesday.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts said weak tax collections so far in April indicate a higher probability that the so-called \"X-date,\" when the government is no longer able to pay all its bills, would be reached in the first half of June. Analysts at Citi said they expected a short-term deal in June or July.\n\nThe Treasury Department has warned that the federal government could reach the moment when it will no longer be able to meet its financial obligations as early as June 5, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast that moment would come sometime between July and September.\n[Market creator] Metaculus Bot\n[Creation date] 04-25-2023\n[Closing data] 07-14-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will the US debt ceiling be raised by the end of June 2023?

Janet Yellen came out earlier in the week and said that the so called \"x date\" may be much earlier than previously thought - possibly as early as 1st June. That seemed to lead to an increase in the chances of an early raising of the debt ceiling, the probability of a rise by the end of May has risen to 27% from a low of about 15% earlier in the week. Does this mean that people think that Yellen is exaggerating but that her comments still mean that the x date is coming sooner than we thought? Meanwhile the probability of a chance of a raise by the end of June has risen to 75% from a low of around 50% The market now has a 90% expectation of a rise by the end of July, with very slightly higher probabilities for each month later in the year. So here are the odds for the four main scenarios when it comes to timing: Increase in May - 27% Increase in June - 48% Increase in July - 15% No increase by the end of July - 10%\n---\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  If they abolish the debt ceiling (even temporarily) so that the government can take on more debt than the current ceiling without the debt limit\/ceiling applying, it would resolve to YES I think that covers the kind of suspension that you're talking about, or did you mean something different?\n---\n[Date]: 05-02-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: One of the main reasons why I set up these markets was to get a bit more context when reading articles like this: https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/05\/01\/biden-congress-debt-ceiling-meeting When news articles and commenters are talking about the urgency of getting something done in the next three or four weeks, it's useful to read it in the knowledge that the prediction market is suggesting that a raising of the ceiling is unlikely in May and there's a significant chance that it won't even be raised by the end of June!\n"],"149":["[Market title] Will Interactive Brokers announce a prediction market platform before the end of 2023?\n[Market description] \n[Market creator] Adrian\n[Creation date] 08-11-2022\n[Closing data] 12-31-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 03-05-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: It looks like the currently available contracts on IBKR are actually  CME Event Contracts , as the ForecastEx application is still pending.

Xi Jinping is the one to propose, endorse, and enforce it. He had considered it his political feat. ( BBC report , NYT report ) I don't think you know how China works. CDC in China has no power or authority. Zero COVID is purely Xi's whim, as is now the easing of restrictions. There simply is no scientific support or basis whatsoever. None. Xi Jinping literally said on the 20th CCP National Congress (2022-10-16), \u6211\u5011\u5805\u6301\u4eba\u6c11\u81f3\u4e0a\u3001\u751f\u547d\u81f3\u4e0a\uff0c\u5805\u6301\u52d5\u614b\u6e05\u96f6\u4e0d\u52d5\u6416\uff0c\u958b\u5c55\u6297\u64ca\u75ab\u60c5\u4eba\u6c11\u6230\u722d\u3001\u7e3d\u9ad4\u6230\u3001\u963b\u64ca\u6230\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8b77\u4e86\u4eba\u6c11\u751f\u547d\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8eab\u9ad4\u5065\u5eb7 We upheld the supremacy of the people and of life, unwaveringly upheld Dynamic Zero COVID, and fought a war against the pandemic to protect the people's safety of life and health of body to the maximum degree.

'dynamic clearing', likewise invented by Xi's writers, means to lock down a city or community whenever there is one case of COVID.

The Zero COVID policy was quite whimsical, willful, and arbitrary. So was the sudden re-opening and easing of Zero COVID. Just a couple of weeks ago, Xi said on a meeting to uphold the Zero COVID policy! After the October CCP national congress. Yes. He FREQUENTLY mentioned and endorsed the Zero COVID policy.

It's the new year in China already.  Time to resolve.  Resolving YES; reasons below. I'll give just two links; as far as I can tell, reporting on this issue is similar across English-language media. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zero-COVID#China https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgecalhoun\/2022\/12\/31\/the-impact-of-chinas-zero-covid-exit-is-china-really-vaccinated\/?sh=7f70341f2e6d Various media articles report that China's zero-covid policy has ended; for example, Forbes (above) calls it China's \"abrupt.... exit from Zero-Covid.\"  Media articles list specific policies that have been relaxed; they don't say what policies, if any, remain in place.  I am left with the impression that life is mostly back to normal.  (International travel into China remains restricted, until Jan. 8; that's the only specific example I found of a policy that remains strict.) I don't know what official case numbers are.  Unofficially, it seems that a large fraction of China's population is infected; I believe this with high confidence*.  AFAIK the government has not moved to impose any new restrictions in response. *  My best guess is that 10-90% of China's population has been infected with Covid in the last month or two. --- Yes, I see that China announced an official policy change dated Jan. 8, and of course this market doesn't care what happens after the new year.  But my best judgement is that Zero Covid is already over.\n---\n[Date]: 12-20-2022\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]: Further thoughts on how I might resolve.  (I don't like those markets where everybody is left to guess \"what does the market creator think about ...\") Warnings: This will not resolve until the end of the year (China local time), plus enough time (a few days) for the media to report on anything that may have happened up to the end of the year.  Also I have not done any research beyond clicking on links y'all posted in the comments. I suggested 4 criteria I might consider.  Well, here we go: -1- Facts on the ground: AFAICT China's covid policy is generally much more lax now.  Maybe not as lax as Western countries, even in 2021 -- I don't have detailed information -- but significantly relaxed compared to a few months ago. -2- AFAICT Western media (who AFAICT coined the term \"Covid Zero\" without definition) pretty much uniformly say that \"Covid Zero\" is over. -3- I don't know what China's official case numbers are, but actual case numbers, I assume, are very high, and I haven't heard that China has done any tighten-things-back-up in response.  However I suppose this could change. -4- That other market seems to be in doubt only because of uncertainty about the meaning of the word \"officially\": does it mean \"by official public decree\", \"by official decision\", or is it an empty filler word with no meaning at all?  If the other market resolves NO because CCP didn't make an official announcement... I don't care. So I think YES is likely at this point.  Here are two possible doubts. -1- I look into things and determine that China's current policy is still quite strict, despite media reports.  I think this is reasonably likely: the media are good at reporting change, bad at reporting absolute numbers (i.e. the media will tell you about the derivative, not the value).  Maybe I will look into things and find China still has a lot of onerous policies, and things have really changed relatively little.  Then factor (1) above might end up as a mild NO vote.  Given factors (2) (3) (4), I expect this market would still resolve YES. -2- China decides to bring back their strict policies.  Oops, jk, changed our minds.  It happens, occasionally. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign If they reinstate the policy before the end of December, then for the purposes of this market, Covid Zero did not \"end in December\".  But if they reinstate Jan. 1, it did.\n---\n[Date]: 12-10-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Here's a plausible scenario.  China does not announce an official change in policy, but the reality on the ground looks like, say, Germany or California in late 2021.  Various restrictions remain in place (e.g. mask mandates, proof of testing required for access to certain indoor venues), while the stricter measures (forced relocation to quarantine centers, not letting people exit residential compounds, blocking travel to and from cities) are cancelled.  This will mean that even known infected people end up getting out into society (as surely happens in the West all the time: when rules are not enforced, not everybody will obey). Assume in addition: Western media say \"Zero Covid ended\"; case numbers in China climb very fast (and China doesn't respond with lockdowns); and related markets resolve to \"Zero Covid is over\".  (I think, given the \"plausible scenario\" above, these \"additional assumptions\" are very likely to hold.) In this scenario I absolutely will resolve to YES. Again, if you want to ask about some other potential scenario, I'd be happy to dicuss.\n---\n[Date]: 12-10-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I assume you read my comment above, where I laid out some of the factors I will consider.

A de facto end to the policy is certainly an end to the policy.  I care about reality on the ground, not official written policy. More subtle: What exactly counts as \"ending Covid Zero\"?  The term never had a precise definition; it was just a word for \"all those strict things China is doing\".  Here are some factors I might consider: -- China's de facto policy: what are the restrictions on the ground?  Where is China's policy in comparison to China's policy mid-2022 and most Western countries' policies mid-2022. -- What Western media say about Covid Zero.  AFAICT the term \"Covid Zero\" was created by Western media (if this is wrong let me know); in the absence of a precise definition, if they say it's over, that probably means it's over. -- China's case numbers (from official reports) and reactions.  \"Covid Zero\" taken literally implies \"zero tolerance\" to cases. -- The resolution of related markets like the following. https:\/\/manifold.markets\/ManifoldMarkets\/china-officially-abandons-covid-zer\n---\n[Date]: 10-27-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Reopened.

Mainland China has administered at least 3,409,697,000 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that\u2019s enough to have vaccinated about 122% of the country\u2019s population. But yes i'm afraid that China is still lack of natural immunity since their vaccines proved not that effective compare to mRNA vaccines. Good news is Covid has become less dangerous than it was which gives China a good exuse to slow down the mRNA vaccines' import. Chinese people know about mRNA, they just don't think it's a necessary to have one. I think it's a bit hard for me to explain the whole logic here but bear in mind that Chinese governament is not willing to spend money (US$) on keeping his people safe. And therefore Chinese people were 'educated' to believe that their governament was really making efforts to protect them from Covid. Everything in China is political. And sadly, trust governament & trust the communist party is the only 'politically correct'.\n---\n[Date]: 09-01-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Hope you find blow helpful. 1.

That leaves 20 more books, which is 10 books per month for the next 2 months. I don't think it's very likely. Maybe if I can quickly go through audiobooks during long walks or runs, I can get to it. It's still possible, but not 50% likely.  I'm 95% confident of getting to 40+ books, though. I won't be selling any of my YES shares or buying NO shares because I don't want to kill all the hope lol. I have however, cancelled all my yes limit orders, as i brace for the market to adjust. This market has helped me get to more books this year than I ever expected after experiencing a disinterest in reading books in the beginning of the year.

Update - finished heroes. Bought and reading mythos.\n---\n[Date]: 09-19-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  unlikely. The best I can do rn is keep my current pace and do 5 books a month, very moderate.  23 done + 2-3 ongoing puts me at 25-26 at the end of September. 1 book a week is a relaxed pace, where I read 30-45 mins a day, to get to 5 books a month, i.e 15 more, to put me at 40 books done.  I could read short books over the weekend to try to sneak in more books for October, but I also have other stuff to do, like writing papers that takes higher priority. \n---\n[Date]: 09-18-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  and fwiw, the true odds of this market are probably under 40, given the time of the year and the progress so far.

I'm really surprised a personal market got this big at all in the first place but anyway, I typically end up reading longer books because I prefer the experience than getting it over with, so it shouldn't be a problem here but yeah, i dont plan to do people dirty haha. I made this market as sort of a tradeoff -> 200 USD to motivate myself to read more this year and would be happy whatever way the market ends up resolving. Definitely wont resolve it as YES if the only reason I was able to cross 50 books was because of some last month tiny books.\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Not really. No hard rule but I feel its a bit of cheating to read a book of 10 pages and count it as 1 when even infinite jest counts as 1. This one is 160 pages and I do count it as a book. I guess atleast 50 pages? Is there a social norm here? If I read 4 short books of 50 pages each, I'm happy to call it as 1 book example, from my comment below where i count a bunch of short books as 1 book else it just feels a bit like being sneaky about it haha\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Starting this book by Neal Stephenson tonight: \"In the Beginning was the Command Line\"\n---\n[Date]: 08-27-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  oopsie, had forgotten to update the title. 22 done.

However, audiobooks take  way  longer to finish for me.  It easily takes 2X the amount of time for me to listen to an audiobook than to read it myself. Benefit is that audiobook can be clubbed with another activity which doesnt demand focus in the same domain, such as exercise!  On the flip side, I often just pick a book, or open on my iPad, and walk around reading it. I choose a space that doesnt have obstacles and allows me to continuously trace a path without spending mental energy. Then I just start reading and walking back and forth.  (I read through  Infinite Jest  over a few months in college by walking up and down the corridor path in my dorm every morning!) These days I'm more likely to record myself reading a book out loud than to listen to an audiobook - this has been a pleasurable activity recently, but I do have 1-2 saved audiobooks that I will listen to, for example :  Genius Makers  - story of Geoff Hinton, Ilya Sutskevar, Alex Net, and the beginning the the deep learning revolution\n---\n[Date]: 07-16-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Well, well, well, the embed just got somewhat better.\n---\n[Date]: 07-14-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  wow the embed is not good for bountied questions\n---\n[Date]: 07-14-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  definitely gonna read atleast a few of the recommendations from the following thread!\n---\n[Date]: 07-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I have a huge  collection  of books to read but not organized whatsoever in a list.

I pondered for a bit why someone would do that. I came up with some potential reasons but none definitive of course. Were his feelings hurt because I dismissed him the other day with a single word? Did his autism simply flare up? Did he ran out of his medication? Maybe seeing his father's belt triggered some bad childhood memories. Or perhaps his favourite cuckold website got shut down.

I've shied away from some of the stuff I used to write about and therefore have serious writer's block but I feel a bit more motivated to continue investing in my blog and add value to my readers.\n\nReasons why I might not complete it:\n* Even though I still try to maximize the value of my life, I've shied heavily away from traditional self-help productivity advice. I think it's helpful for certain types of people with certain mindsets, but I've been more focused on a different dimensionality of my life and found it hard to incorporate that into my writing on productivity\n* Part 6 is about relationship management, which means I would talk about how to interact with people. I don't think I've cracked that puzzle yet to really make a definitive statement on how to approach that\n* A little bit of scope-creep moment but I would also want to move away from Wordpress onto a different publishing platform,. which would add more work to my writing.\n* I have 3 week-long travel trips coming up in Q3.\n\nReasons I might complete it:\n* I have a draft for part 5 so I would technically only need 1 part left\n* I've decided to cut back on social activities and dating in Q3, which would net me about extra 10hrs a week. I haven't planned for how to spend those 10 hrs\/week yet\n* I've made a lot of progress understanding human relationships in the past year via a combination of dating, improv, and therapy, so maybe I could have enough confidence to write about relationships.\n* I have a sinking suspicion that my online presence affects my irl interactions with people and have some motivation to align my writing with my current thoughts and philosophy.\n[Market creator] jmaa\n[Creation date] 07-07-2022\n[Closing data] 10-01-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"157":["[Market title] Will the Barbie (2023) movie be a box office success within one week of its theatrical release?\n[Market description] The market resolves to YES if the Barbie movie grosses >=2.5 times its cost (production + marketing) in total box office earnings worldwide a week after its theatrical release; else, it resolves to NO.\n\nAs of writing, the movie's production budget is $100 million but its marketing budget undisclosed.\n\nJan 2, 2:14am: Will the Barbie (2023) movie be a box office success? \u2192 Will the Barbie (2023) movie be a box office success within one week of its theatrical release?\n[Market creator] Bryan Tan \ud83e\udee1\n[Creation date] 01-01-2023\n[Closing data] 07-27-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 01-01-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Thanks for the input.

Given the current political climate and potential for social unrest, it is uncertain whether there will be at least one big riot in the United States before April 15th, 2023.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, a \"big riot\" is defined as an event of rioting or civil unrest in which any of the following conditions are met:\n\nAt least 5 people die directly due to violence, either due to the actions of rioters or other civilians, or police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents.\n\nAt least 250 people are arrested by police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents.\n\nAn \"event of rioting\" is defined as a continuous period of unrest involving a significant number of participants (at least 50 people), marked by property damage, violent confrontations with law enforcement, and\/or physical altercations among participants, that:\n\nOccurs within a specific geographic area, defined as an area of no more than 50 square miles (129.5 square kilometers) where the majority of the unrest activities take place, and\n\nLasts for at least 2 hours without a break of more than 30 minutes, and\n\nIs primarily driven by a common political, social, or economic issue or grievance.\n\nFor deaths to count toward the overall death toll, the deaths have to occur within the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest; deaths from a generic mass shooting or a series of homicides that occur outside of the context of a riot shouldn't count towards the 5. Further, deaths that occur due to medical emergencies that aren't related to rioting or unrest do not count (for example, someone dying of a heart attack while in a crowd of rioters).

And we should generally buy talent at wide receiver in fantasy football.\n\nSo, yeah, this one is a little tough for me to write.\n\nSituationally, I'm just a little worried as the Steelers get acclimated to this new era. Over the last two seasons, only Tampa Bay has thrown more passes than Pittsburgh. Johnson's seen an impressive target share over these two years -- it was at 27.5% per game last year and 23.6% the year before -- and that resulted in huge target totals. He's fourth in the NFL at wide receiver in total targets during this time.\n\nPittsburgh is almost definitely going to be more run-heavy without Ben Roethlisberger. That'll naturally lower Johnson's volume. But what if whoever's under center isn't peppering Johnson the same way Big Ben did?\n\nJohnson's average depth of target ranked in the 24th percentile among 50-plus target wideouts last year, largely because the Steelers ran an offense that surrounded the idea of getting the ball out quick. With a more mobile passer and a hopefully improved offensive line, what if that changes? What if that allows players like Chase Claypool and George Pickens to develop more plays down the field?\n\nThis isn't to say Johnson's incapable of doing that, too. Again, he's a great wide receiver. There's just an outcome here where he's not seeing the same type of volume in the Pittsburgh offense this year, which is concerning for fantasy purposes.\n\nContext: \n\nIn his August 23rd, 2022 email newsletter, fantasy football analyst JJ Zachariason outlines 15 bold predictions that he describe as \"really possible\":\n\nWhy share a bunch of fantasy football bold predictions if they\u2019re not actually useful?\n\u00a0\nYou probably know by now that I\u2019m all about having a process in fantasy football.\n\nThat extends to bold predictions.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, bold predictions are just looking at either side of some range of outcomes.

They also play for the same team, potentially limiting each other's upside.\nWhy This Will Happen: With Tim Patrick no longer in the picture, we could see Denver's targets heavily funneled to Sutton and Jeudy. KJ Hamler isn't totally 100%, and the tight ends there are inexperienced.\n\nMeanwhile, Russell Wilson is one of five quarterbacks since 2011 with a touchdown rate north of 6%. The Broncos new head coach, Nathaniel Hackett, coordinated the Packers offense from 2019 through 2021, where they saw the most pass attempts at the goal line combined with the second-highest pass rate from that area of the field.\n\nTo put that all another way: We could see a lot of passing touchdowns in Denver this year.\n\nSince 2011, an average of 1.6 wide receiver teammates have finished together in the top-12 in PPR points per game per season. Sutton and Jeudy could be one of those pairs this year.\n\nContext: \n\nIn his August 23rd, 2022 email newsletter, fantasy football analyst JJ Zachariason outlines 15 bold predictions that he describe as \"really possible\":\n\nWhy share a bunch of fantasy football bold predictions if they\u2019re not actually useful?\n\u00a0\nYou probably know by now that I\u2019m all about having a process in fantasy football.\n\nThat extends to bold predictions.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, bold predictions are just looking at either side of some range of outcomes.

That's a 78th percentile mark among 50-plus target wide receivers.\n\nHe wasn't able to hit even 130 targets last year because of the run-heavy scheme he was in, but his target share was above 25%. Since 2011, check out the second-year wide receivers with a per-game target share of 25% or higher to go along with a yards per route run rate of 1.9: Josh Gordon, AJ Brown, Sammy Watkins, Justin Jefferson, Odell Beckham, Michael Thomas, Mike Evans, Alshon Jeffery, AJ Green, DeAndre Hopkins, Allen Robinson, Courtland Sutton, Jarvis Landry, Kendall Wright, and our man, Michael Pittman.\n\nThat's some very good company.\n\nWith Matt Ryan now under center, there's a chance we see a little more passing from Indy this year. It could all come together and make Pittman a top-five fantasy wideout.\n\nContext: \n\nIn his August 23rd, 2022 email newsletter, fantasy football analyst JJ Zachariason outlines 15 bold predictions that he describe as \"really possible\":\n\nWhy share a bunch of fantasy football bold predictions if they\u2019re not actually useful?\n\u00a0\nYou probably know by now that I\u2019m all about having a process in fantasy football.\n\nThat extends to bold predictions.\n\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, bold predictions are just looking at either side of some range of outcomes.

Firstly the resolution source of this market is intended to be essentially based on asking people with informed opinions about it, and then subjectively aggregating them together somehow - that's what was meant by \"judge the mathematical community's assessment of the paper\". So it wasn't possible to write down specific examples ahead of time without polling people about a bunch of hypothetical scenarios (which would be a lot of work). And of course, trying to figure out how to score things on a numeric scale is always hard. In this sense, it's similar to markets predicting the result of a poll, like  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/SneakySly\/at-the-end-of-2023-will-manifold-us  or  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/jack\/will-we-believe-sbf-committed-willf . But using a subjective aggregation instead of a simple average to give more flexibility to do things like weight opinions of different people, etc. The rough numbers I got for the hypothetical scenarios you proposed were 99%, 90%, 50%, 10% - so pretty similar (that was also with a couple minutes of thought, from someone who isn't an expert in the subfield). Feel free to write a market! It seems like you know a lot more about the specific implications of the work. I'll probably make a slightly different market too and then we can try out variants with slightly different resolution criteria. Also, I agree on the feature suggestion, I think more generally a feature that allows us to draft markets collaboratively would be great and help with these sorts of cases.\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks for the detailed commentary. Let me get back to you on the cases you suggested - at a glance that seems reasonable. Yeah, if I were a number theorist myself and resolving by my own judgement I would definitely want to include some examples like that, this question is much less well operationalized because I'm not sufficiently familiar with the math. The binary question was how I had originally framed it - YES if it has proven the claimed result (or one with largely the same consequences). But after some discussion I realized this also had a problematic amount of subjectivity. I'm not a number theorist and I don't remember the details of the discussion very clearly, but I think it was similar to the examples you suggested above. You are probably right that trying to set the boundary between yes and no is still cleaner than trying to score all the potential outcomes, though. I could open a second version of this question based on that if people are interested.\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: What's your new information?

Novel ideas but far from proving a result with the important consequences would likely be <50%. If it can prove a result that still achieves the important consequences, but the stated result turns out to be much harder to achieve, that's more like 90%. All of this is very subjective of course.\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  To answer your questions: I expect novel ideas but far from proving the stated result would be closer to 0% than 100%. The \"crank, no new ideas\" basically just means the same thing as \"no new ideas\", I guess \"crank\" is there for example\/illustrative purposes. I think any serious attempt will almost surely have some new idea (even if it's that something doesn't work), and therefore get a positive resolution.\n---\n[Date]: 12-14-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  It's subjective, trade at your own risk. Do you have suggestions for a better resolution criteria? I brainstormed the question with a couple people and all the possibilities that captured the intent of the question were highly subjective, I think that's unavoidable. An objective question could be whether he publishes a result meeting some specific criteria in a journal, but like I mentioned above, it's very easy for the work to prove something useful and interesting but not the claimed result.\n---\n[Date]: 11-08-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Original text for reference: Resolves YES if the mathematical community's consensus is Yitang Zhang has proven the claimed result (or one with largely the same consequences) by the end of 2023. Resolves NO if the consensus is that he has not. Resolves N\/A if there is no consensus. So, if the proof is flawed, but such flaws are not serious, or any serious flaws are corrected by the end of 2023, then that would be a YES. If the claimed bound is incorrect but it can be corrected to another bound that yields largely the same consequences, that would be a YES.)\n---\n[Date]: 11-08-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I made some changes to the resolution method after talking with a mathematician who pointed out that it's quite possible for it to prove something important but substantially weaker than the original claim.

The recent Sheltering Humanity against Existential Risks (SHELTER) conference highlighted several uncertainties in the potential value of shelters as an X-risk intervention. Of these uncertainties, one aspect concerns the technical feasibility and cost of surface independent self sufficient food and life support systems (water, energy). Filling this knowledge gap would allow informed decision making to either rule out shelters as a cost effective x-risk intervention or catalyze development and deployment, estimated at 100 million to 1 billion USD (high value of information). ALLFED is uniquely positioned to lead research in this area due to knowledge in relevant resilient food production methods and experience in cost effectiveness analysis.\n\nHere's the mechanism by which the applicant expects their project will achieve positive outcomes.\n\n\nPreliminary technical analysis fleshes out the technical feasibility and requirements of shelters\u2019 life support systems (food, water, energy) reducing current uncertainties around cost and increasing specificity and tangibility of developing shelters. This allows informed decision making on whether shelters should be pursued or abandoned as a cost effective means of X-risk reduction. If results are favorable, we expect that interested parties will be motivated to begin further R&D, using preliminary technical analysis to inform development plans. Interested parties (industry, non-profit, gov) set up orgs and develop and pilot required tech. Parties collaborate to combine various technologies to create and pilot shelter design(s). Full scale implementation of shelters capable of sustaining a minimum viable population occurs. Humanity has the capacity to survive extinction-level events and repopulate after a range of X-risks (though this is dependent on results of civilization recovery research).\u00a0\n\nHow much funding are they requesting?\n\n\n$500,000\n\n\nWhat would they do with the amount specified?\n\nResearch - $407,500 USD:\u00a0\n\nPreliminary nutrition assessment of closed loop food - months 1 - 6\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Juan Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, ALLFED Research Associate (existing)\n\nAs discussed above preliminary nutrition analysis would be initiated immediately.\n\nHiring of researchers - months 1 - 3:\u00a0\n\nALLFED ops staff\u00a0\n\nHire researchers (2 researchers for 18 months) with relevant skills to undertake technical analysis.\n\nTechnical analysis of shelters life support systems - months 3 - 21\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Juan Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, ALLFED Research Associate (existing), Research Associate (new hires), Specialist Advisors (multiple individuals)\n\nThis would focus on the following topics (in addition to nutrition and cost effectiveness) covering technical analysis of key shelter requirements to be investigated:\u00a0\n\nShelter in-situ closed loop food production\n\nShelter heat rejection\u00a0\n\nShelter energy production\n\nShelter recovery food (maintaining farming with a small population)\u00a0\n\nShelter in-situ closed loop material, water and waste management\n\n\nStakeholder mapping and consultation- $92,500 USD:\n\nStakeholder mapping and consultation - months 6 - 21\u00a0\n\nSpecialist advisor(s) and ALLFED research associate (existing):\n\nExisting researcher in association with a specialist advisor(s) would map key players (industry, academia, gov) and convert academic publications to formats suitable for target audience.

The text beneath each heading was written by the applicant. Alternatively, you can click here to see the entire public portion of their application. \n\nIn brief, why does the applicant think we should we fund this project?\n\nBiosecurity Legislative Boot Camp: Congressional funding and support for pandemic preparedness, biodefense, and biosecurity monitoring falls short of addressing the scope of the threat and of fully utilizing available technology and capabilities (e.g., vaccine production; BARDA; wastewater pathogen sampling). Bringing these issues to the attention of policymakers and those who directly advise them could result in increased attention, and ultimately better-informed, faster, and concerted legislative action. The boot camp format has previously been used to increase awareness of policy solutions to cybersecurity problems and to build a network among congressional staffers and research-affiliated experts; this network has resulted in ongoing consultative opportunities and participants\u2019 involvement in crafting cybersecurity policy, which I expect would translate to the domain of biosecurity with the involvement of appropriate personnel and experts in a similarly formatted program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDual-Use Capabilities of Protein Folding Tools: Recent advancements in AI- and ML-enabled molecular modeling and simulation have led to breakthroughs in the ability to predict protein folding and bound structures of multiple proteins (e.g., ligand-receptor docking and antibody binding). While some work has been done on the potential applications of these capabilities to chemical design, and the dual-use nature of this work, very little has been done thus far to explore the current and near-term capabilities of protein-folding simulation tools to enable the directed design of pathogens. It is important to know the capabilities of these tools to design mechanisms of safety and review for their use, and to predict potential misuse for the purpose of planning for or mitigating the results of that misuse.\n\nHere's the mechanism by which the applicant expects their project will achieve positive outcomes.\n\nBootcamp: As with previous bootcamps, I expect that sustained and intensive engagement with these issues and a small community of both fellow staffers and experts will do two things: heighten the saliency of these topics and issues for the staffers, and create informal networking relationships and bonds between participants (both among staffers, and between staffers and experts) that lead to consultation and collaboration in the near future. The small, informal, and off-the-record nature of the bootcamps tends to build camaraderie better than a formal public conference, and staffers feel important for having been purposely selected to attend, causing them to view their fellow attendees as being similarly important, and therefore worthy of working with in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nResearch: Publication and dissemination of research about dual-use capabilities tends to attract the attention of regulators and researchers (see, e.g., the attention paid to Filippa Lentzos et al.\u2019s recent publication on dual-use AI-enabled drug discovery - https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s42256-022-00465-9). Presentations and talks to relevant groups (nonproliferation groups, university departments and programs, State Department CTR) are also good mechanisms for propagating this type of work and spurring the development of regulatory guidelines, but the research and computational work has to be done first to demonstrate the reality of the threat.\n\nHow much funding are they requesting? \n\nBootcamp: $130,225\n\nResearch: $6,000\/month stipend for 12 months - $72,000.\u00a0\n\nTotal: $130,225 + $72,000 + 8% overhead: $218,403\n\nOverview bootcamp budget:\n\nFlights, transportation to\/from campus, and accommodations for ~30 staffers\n\nAssuming 30 participants, $58,500 total\n\nRoom reservations, event services, waste management\n\n$5,500 total\n\nBreakfast (2x), Lunch (3x), and Dinner (2x) catering\n\nAssuming 30 participants, $10,575 total\n\nStaff time (facilitator\/organizer, logistics coordinator)\n\nAssume 80 hours each for prep for logistics and organizer\n\n12 hours per day for three days each for the event\n\n10 hours each for post-event work (reimbursements, communication)\n\nAssume $75\/hour, four staff, $32,400\n\nStipends for travel and time for visiting speakers\n\n$18,500 total\n\nPrinted materials\n\n$2,250 total\n\nField trip (if possible)\n\n$2,500 total\n\nHere you can review the entire public portion of the application (which contains a lot more information about the applicant and their project):\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1Eh4C5ThTWTR0JP-oUXkWbFrmjo9h3XP4DnXQODP8pso\/edit\n\nSep 20, 3:45pm: \n\n\nClose date updated to 2022-10-01 2:59 am\n[Market creator] Clearer Thinking Regrants\n[Creation date] 09-15-2022\n[Closing data] 10-01-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 10-17-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Note that, as per our Tournament rules, \"A market will resolve in favor of a project being funded if Clearer Thinking selects that project as one to provide any funding to (even if, for some reason, the project fails to receive the money - for instance, if it is shut down by the people running it before the money is received).\"\u00a0 We selected the bootcamp component of this project and recommended that the Future Fund provide funding to it, which is why the market is resolving as \"yes.\" However, the Future Fund did not act on our recommendation to give a grant to the bootcamp because another regrantor has recently recommended to fund it already.

The text beneath each heading was written by the applicant. Alternatively, you can click here to see the entire public portion of their application. \n\nWhy the applicant thinks we should fund this project\n\nActors in the effective altruist and longtermist space face significant uncertainties such as how to frame EA and longtermism to be most effective in convincing key players, policymakers, or new segments of the general public. Rethink Priorities\u2019 Survey Team can help with those questions by conducting timely and accurate polls, surveys and messaging studies. Being able to talk about our movement in a way that is more aware of how the public will perceive it will allow us to better grow and shape the movement going forward, especially in the face of a lot of new media growth. \n\nWe face broad strategic questions affecting the movement as a whole (e.g. \u201cWhat are the implications of associating \u2018effective altruism\u2019 and \u2018longtermism\u2019?\u201d, or \u201cWhat are the costs and benefits of developing separate brands such as \u2018global priorities research\u2019?\u201d) that we don\u2019t have good answers to yet. Our research will help with that. Our work can also reduce significant downside risks for the movement and potentially reduce the risk of negative and unexpected PR backlash.\n\nHere's the mechanism by which the applicant expects their project will achieve positive outcomes.\n\nOur research will help identify which messages, arguments and framings can be expected to perform better or worse, as well as what generally leads to different approaches performing better or worse with specific audiences. EA and longtermist organizations can then optimize their outreach based on these insights. EA and longtermist actors can likewise mitigate the risk of harm to the movement by avoiding messages which might seem reasonable to EAs, but which provoke negative reactions from other groups.\n\nOur work can also identify potential harms to the movement by providing an early warning where EA or longtermism and their associated ideas are perceived negatively (for example, by identifying public misconceptions), allowing decision-makers to take ameliorative action (for example, by working to correct or avoid these misconceptions).\u00a0\n\nOur research could also inform decision-makers\u2019 actions regarding concrete initiatives. For example, decision-makers might be reluctant to support an initiative due to concern that it will be seen as \u2018weird\u2019 by the public. Yet empirical research might show that this concern is misplaced (and, conversely, initiatives which decision-makers believed to be innocuous, might be perceived negatively).\n\nTo sum up, Rethink Priorities produces insights which help effective altruists better understand how the lay public thinks about EA and longtermism, which helps to better position EA for future growth, potentially reallocating resources, shifting programs, or proposing successful policies.\n\nHow much funding are they requesting?\n\n\n$ 457,950\n\n\nWhat would they do with the amount just specified?\n\nWe would make sure the current Surveys Team is funded reliably so that they can work on the projects they deem most high-impact rather than only chasing contracts or doing pro bono work for organizations.\n\n\nWe would pay salaries, including all taxes and benefits, for 3 FTE researchers.\u00a0\n\n\nWe would spend another $11,200 on directly project-related research supplies, equipment, technology, and travel.\n\nEmploying these three staff to work on this project also creates administrative costs (HR, communications, finance, development, etc.), which is necessary to sustain the research and enable the work of the team going forward. However, we understand if your fund cannot cover these operating expenses.\n\nHere you can review the entire public portion of the application (which contains a lot more information about the applicant and their project):\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1a1HJqU20IuM5RHH63MRPfwWfhaYIMxhYxRU4ZzUA0pM\n\nSep 20, 3:43pm: \n[Market creator] Clearer Thinking Regrants\n[Creation date] 09-17-2022\n[Closing data] 10-01-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 10-20-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Note that, as per our Tournament rules, \"A market will resolve in favor of a project being funded if Clearer Thinking selects that project as one to provide any funding to (even if, for some reason, the project fails to receive the money - for instance, if it is shut down by the people running it before the money is received).\"\u00a0 We selected this project and recommended that the Future Fund provide funding to it, which is why the market is resolving as \"yes.\" As the Surveys Team noted in their public copy of their application, they have received funding in the past from the Future Fund for a different project, described as tracking \"awareness of and attitudes towards effective altruism and related issues among the US population.\" However, the Future Fund did not act on our recommendation to give a grant to this new project at this time.

Thank you! I was not thinking about such possibility. Creating markets is hard.  I was thinking how should I handle this possibility. At first I thought that in such case I should resolve it as n\/a, as this is an event that was not explicitly stated in the market description. But after thinking a bit more, I think that this is ok to resolve this market as NO if the summit is moved to some other country from  South Africa. My rationality about it that the needed country is explicitly stated in the market subject 'Will Vladimir Putin attend BRICS summit in South Africa in August?' and I'm not changing it. And this NO resolution plays well with the other NO resolutions already stated in the market description. So, in case the summit will be in August 2023, but it will be held in some other country (not in South Africa) I will resolve this market as NO (no matter if Vladimir Putin will attend it or not).

Ramaphosa\u2019s government is increasingly anxious to dissuade him from coming given a looming clash with Pretoria\u2019s legal obligations. \n\n\u201cSouth Africa has obvious problems with executing a request to arrest and surrender President Putin\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it would be inconsistent with our constitution to risk engaging in war with Russia,\u201d Ramaphosa said. \n\nAs a member of the ICC, South Africa would risk breaking its own and international law if it sought to avoid arresting Putin, after the court indicted him on war crimes charges over child abductions in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThe Rome Statute treaty underpinning the ICC does allow states to consult the court if they encounter problems executing its warrants, the avenue South Africa is now using.

I would not extend the date unless some unforeseen circumstances meant the 2043 prizes were delayed or otherwise unclear for some reason.  Good question about living recipients, a quick Google suggests that you can\u2019t be nominated posthumously but you can be awarded the prize posthumously if you die between announcement and award.  To maintain the spirit of the question, if Kwon Young-Wan dies before market close then I think it\u2019s fairest to await the next round of Nobel prizes to confirm that he has not been awarded, and then the question can resolve NO early. If he does fall into that small camp of posthumous awards then the question will resolve YES. \n---\n[Date]: 08-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I\u2019m not sure.

This market resolves to the rent we are charged for the month of September 2023.\n\nWe split rent payments evenly between us, but this resolves to the total rent we pay together, not the rent either one of us pays on our own.

I will state that rent prices are stupidly high there, and that the rent we pay for a pet-friendly one-bedroom apartment will almost certainly fall within the $1,250 to $1,850 range. In the (presumably unlikely) event that we're charged anything other than an even dollar amount (e.g. if we're charged $1X99.50), I'll round to the nearest dollar.\n\nI will not bet on this market, aside from some small bets (60 mana total) to set the starting probabilities. While my partner and I will have an apartment found well in advance of September, this market won't actually close and resolve until we have fully paid the first month's rent, likely at some point in the final week of August.

Any capability to undo (even if it's just a few seconds) will count for the purposes of this market.\n\nMotivation: People accidentally resolve markets incorrectly sometimes. This is a recent real-world example: https:\/\/manifold.markets\/Austin\/what-contributions-will-we-list-on#Df3a0jEtLDQ9qEJKQO1Y. I think it would be good if the author can undo the resolution of their market. This would undo all of the payouts made by the incorrect resolution (undoing transactions is not a new concept, it's similar to how N\/A undos all of the trades). Then the author can resolve to the correct resolution, or the market can stay open if it wasn't supposed to be resolved yet. This should probably be subject to reasonable limitations - e.g. can only fix the resolution within some grace period. Perhaps in the future it could require approval by other parties. But I think given that authors freely editing markets was added without any issue, allowing authors to undo resolution shortly after an accidental mistake would be much more likely to allow fixing mistakes than to be abused.\n[Market creator] Jack\n[Creation date] 09-08-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-13-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Follow-up market for 2023:\n---\n[Date]: 12-13-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Another benefit - being able to change resolutions would also make our lives better in many markets where the market is almost certain but not completely certain to resolve a certain way.

(Any markets resolved dishonorably prior to this market's creation don't count.) The dishonorable market must also have closed after this market began.\n\nFor the purposes of determining what counts as a dishonorable resolution, I will go by @MattP's judgement, unless there's a community consensus that I should not do so. (For example if there are concerns that @MattP resolved one of their own markets incorrectly, or @MattP has become inactive.) In that case I'll use my judgement instead. (If there's a community consensus I'll defer to that; my personal judgement will only enter into it if the community can't agree.) \n\nA late resolution doesn't count as dishonorable until the creator has been reminded at least once after the market closed and still hasn't resolved the market.

I see that as a feature rather than a bug; it means there's little incentive for creators to resolve their own markets dishonorably, since they can't turn a profit here by doing so.\n\nIf any market creator wants to convince others of their trustworthiness, they can stake M$ on themselves here to prove it.

The key issue is that normally if someone asks a question like \"Will this market have >100k total bet on it by 10\/31\" it is implicit that the market remains open for the duration. Authors could abuse it just closing the market whenever they feel like to force a NO resolution, but that would be considered a trick. Spindle could also have closed down the market and waited to resolve no on 10\/31, and that would have also violated the traders' reasonable expectations. Also, this is not an attack on Spindle, I'm just trying to decide how to resolve this meta-market. I think it was a fun trick market, and the fact that Spindle creates trick markets is something traders can take into account when looking at future markets. As has been said before, deciding whether a market was improperly resolved is not necessarily a statement about whether it was morally bad, just a statement about what traders should have expected and whether they should be wary of potential misresolutions in the future.\n---\n[Date]: 09-16-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Right. It's important whether the author correctly followed the market's resolution procedure, not just whether the result ended up being correct. Added a note on that to the market description.\n---\n[Date]: 09-16-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: There's some debate over this one. Spindle resolved it early, which ensured that the answer would be NO. However, the answer only became a certain NO  because  Spindle resolved NO - it's not true that the answer was determined, and then Spindle resolved it. So currently I consider it improper or dubious at least. Also, more important than the technicalities is the motivating question of whether it's what a reasonable bettor would have expected. I think no.\n---\n[Date]: 09-08-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yep, thanks for adding it, that definitely counts as incorrect resolution as per Austin's comment  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/Austin\/what-contributions-will-we-list-on#Df3a0jEtLDQ9qEJKQO1Y\n---\n[Date]: 09-08-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: It seems like Manifold is converging on 30 days without an author response as a reasonable deadline (it's now in the community guidelines). I also agree that for typical cases of the author disappearing for example, that's quite  reasonable. But if e.g. a resolving event occurred but nobody noticed (and it wasn't grossly negligent not to notice) then I wouldn't hold that against the author. It gets more complicated if the author is responding and potentially working diligently to resolve, or stalling.\n---\n[Date]: 08-31-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: I was a bit worried about this one for a while given that profits and bets were made private, but I think it ended up being fine. Even if it had resolved N\/A I think I would still have rated it pretty low on the \"improper resolution\" scale. Just thought it was worth adding here as an interesting case study.\n---\n[Date]: 08-31-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Hmm, I haven't thought it through a lot, mostly it's pretty case by case, but here are some initial thoughts: It depends on the reason for the lateness. If it's simply forgotten about, and nobody reminded the author, I might not count that at all. But if it continued to be abandoned after reminders for no good reason for say a few weeks, that would probably count. (Btw, there really should be a better system to remind the author to resolve.) If it was because the market takes a lot of fact-finding to figure out the correct resolution, that in theory could have happened sooner but the author was busy, I think I probably would excuse even longer delays. Any amount of delay for what I think of as an improper reason would cause me to count it here. DrP's market  https:\/\/manifold.markets\/DrP\/will-donald-j-trump-be-the-presiden  I count as improper, because their stated reason is pretty clearly a flimsy cover for trolling the market participants.\n---\n[Date]: 08-31-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Not actually a paradox :) I don't think this will happen, but there's some chance I will judge myself to be unable to resolve this market correctly and fairly, in which case it's possible I'd include this option.\n"],"182":["[Market title] Will Rudy Giuliani be charged by the DA in Fulton County for his role in efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia?\n[Market description] Resolves YES if Rudy Giuliani is charged in Fulton County, GA for his role in the attempt to overturn the election results in that state.

At close, the script only logged evergreenemily and Odoacre, but for  's net worth to update only a few minutes after that, and based on when they commented, I think it's very probable that their net worth was greater than 25K at close.

A few stipulations:\n* The blockchain in question has to be permissionless - it should be possible for an individual with the formalized proof in hand to obtain the bounty without going through any KYC process (excluding, possibly, the process of obtaining some cryptocurrency to pay a transaction fee).\n* For the purposes of this question, a smart contract running on a \"Layer 2\" platform such as a rollup counts as a smart contract.\n* The proof doesn't necessarily have to be extractable from the transaction - For example, if the contract accepts a SNARKed proof of the existence of a formal proof, that counts.\n* The theorems for which the bounties are offered must be intentional. One might perversely define any bug in any smart contract to be a bounty for a proof of the bug expressed as an exploit - that doesn't count.\n* Moreover theorems must be \"mathematical\". One could imagine an intentionally-made bug bounty for a program with a smart contract that rewards a proof of an exploit, but that wouldn't count: This focuses more on formalizations of problems which are more explicitly mathematical. Examples might include: \n  * Open problems such as P vs NP, or the Riemann Hypothesis. \n  * Resolved-but-complicated theorems such as FLT.\n  * Easier mathematical theorems such as the infinitude of primes.\n* Blurring the line for the above might be a bounty for a proof-of-correctness for some cryptographic scheme which relies heavily on mathematical concepts.

This breakthrough, insight or technique must be easily succinctly and accurately summarizable within a combined total of 5000 words and 2000 mathematical symbols, such that if that summary had been handed to a mathematician working in the same area just a few years prior, then that mathematician would likely have been able to solve the full conjecture within a year without the aid of any AI more advanced than what existed in 2015.\n\nTo measure this, the published article should:\n\nExplicitly identify the AI's discovery of the primary breakthrough, insight, or technique.\n\nExplain how this discovery was pivotal in solving the conjecture.\n\nProvide evidence that this discovery was a major challenge for human mathematicians to discover, such as citing prior unsuccessful attempts or highlighting the novelty of the AI's approach.\n\nTo determine whether the AI's discovery was \"pivotal\", the following aspects should be examined in the published article:\n\nNecessity: The article should explain why the AI's discovery was necessary for the solution, demonstrating that without this discovery, the conjecture would remain unsolved or the proof would be invalid.\n\nNovelty: The article should highlight the novelty of the AI's discovery, showing how it differs from previous approaches and why it was instrumental in resolving the conjecture. This can include a comparison to earlier attempts that were unsuccessful or an explanation of the unique aspects of the AI's approach.\n\nImpact: The article should discuss the impact of the AI's discovery on the solution process, such as how it led to the development of other essential components of the proof or how it provided a new perspective that enabled the resolution of the conjecture.\n\nThe question will resolve as \"No\" if no AI system fully solves any important mathematical conjecture on the combined list of unsolved problems from the mentioned sources according to the above criteria before January 1st, 2030.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 03-16-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2030\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 03-19-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I have now re-written the question to provide a better standard for what journals should count.\n---\n[Date]: 03-16-2023\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  OK I intend to re-write this part of the question later today to expand the list of journals. FWIW, this question was written by GPT-4.\n","[Market title] Will AIs be widely recognized as having developed a new, innovative, foundational mathematical theory before 2030?\n[Market description] This question proposes a grand challenge for AI, setting an extremely high bar for the field, intended to measure when AIs will be considered on par with, or having surpassed the brightest humans in the world at mathematics. While competetive mathematics, such as the IMO and Putnam, provide concrete benchmarks for mathematical reasoning, mathematicians have long recognized that there is more to mathematics than competetive, narrow problem solving. Famous mathematicians, such as Gauss, Hilbert, and Grothendieck, have fundamentally reshaped humanity's understanding of mathematics by not only solving some narrow problems, but by introducing new fundamental mathematical theories.\n\nMathematical theories are systematic frameworks composed of definitions, axioms, and propositions that are used to analyze and interpret the properties and relationships of certain mathematical entities or structures. They are fundamental to all areas of mathematics, and many theories are so foundational that they're often just considered part of the discipline rather than an individual theory. Foundational math theories include number theory, graph theory, group theory, topology, chaos theory, category theory, knot theory, algebraic geometry, and set theory.\n\nWill AIs be widely recognized as having developed at least one new, innovative, foundational mathematical theory before 2030?\n\nHere are some important definitions:\n\nNew Mathematical Theory: A 'new mathematical theory' for the purposes of this question must be a systematic and original framework of abstract concepts, propositions, and methods that significantly extends existing mathematical knowledge or explores a previously uncharted area of mathematics. It should demonstrate logical coherence and internal consistency, and have aided in the solution of previously unsolved problems that have evaded mathematicians for many years.\n\nAI Involvement: The new theory must have been primarily developed by AI systems, where 'development' involves the generation of the main theoretical concepts, propositions, and methods, and not just assistance in computations or the execution of tasks designed by human mathematicians.\n\nInnovation: The new theory must be innovative, meaning it should not be a straightforward extension or minor modification of existing theories, but rather should introduce new mathematical objects, concepts, or methods, or provide significant new insights into existing ones. \n\nFoundational: The new theory should also be widely recognized as foundational, meaning it has had a substantial impact on the field and has opened up new research avenues. Conclusive proof that this criterion is met will be obtained if the theory is used to solve a problem in the Open Problem Garden within one year that was previously mentioned in the literature at least 50 different times but unsolved for a period of at least five years.\n\nRecognition by the Mathematical Community: The theory, including its exposition and applications, must have been published in at least three highly respected, peer-reviewed mathematical journals. Furthermore, it should have been cited in subsequent mathematical literature a significant number of times, at least 500 times across all publications, within five years of publication, and before 2030, in non-self-referential works.\n\nIndependent Verification: The theory's validity and its utility in providing mathematical insight should be confirmed by independent and credible testimonials from more than ten mathematicians represented at American and European universities, including at least two living fields medalists.\n\nIf a new, innovative, foundational mathematical theory is developed primarily by AIs meeting these criteria, as determined by the question author in his best judgement before 2030, potentially upon the advice of experts, then this question resolves to YES. Otherwise, it resolves to NO.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 07-24-2023\n[Closing data] 01-02-2030\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"185":["[Market title] [CAPTURE THE FLAG] Will anyone from the comments go to 37.810718, -122.424848?

Crown Fountain (an installation in Chicago that exactly matches the criteria in the description) generally turns on the water (the part required to meet the \"interactive\" criterion) on May 1, as long as weather permits. There was warm weather in the Midwest this weekend, so I'm pretty much certain is was turned on.

I would define an interaction between the face and passers-by as meaning that either the actions of the passers-by affect what the face does in some way (e.g., the face is programmed to look at random people), or the face can do something that affects passers-by in a more substantial way than just \"they see the face and have whatever psychological response that causes\".\n---\n[Date]: 04-11-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think the smallest face in the image is about 20 ft. tall, so I'll set that as the threshold for minimum face height required, unless anyone has any objections.\n"],"186":["[Market title] Will a religion that has some AI as its god, oracle or priest have at least 1 million churchgoers before 2051?\n[Market description] \n[Market creator] Franklin Baldo\n[Creation date] 12-16-2022\n[Closing data] 01-01-2051\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 12-17-2022\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  if it is not possible to independently verify the existence of the AI, it is not a YES.

In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia's suspension of participation in the New START treaty and hinted at the development of new nuclear weapons if the U.S. conducted any nuclear tests\u200b. This was followed by the announcement in March that Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by July\u200b.\n\nSeveral violent incidents also occurred, including a bombing in Saint Petersburg in April that resulted in the death of a military blogger and injury to numerous others\u200b, and a car bomb attack in May that injured a pro-war nationalist and killed his driver\u200b\u200b. These events point to a heightened state of unrest.\n\nIn the same period, relations with other countries have deteriorated, as seen in the ban on Armenian dairy imports\u200b, and there are hints that Russia might withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal\u200b\u200b. Domestically, human rights and independent organizations have come under scrutiny, such as the SOVA Center, which was ordered to close by the Moscow City Court in April\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn June 23, Russia accused Yevgeny Prigozhin of calling for a rebellion\u200b.

Isolated or sporadic incidents of violence will not qualify as a civil war.\n\nThe conflict has caused at least 100 casualties or territorial changes, or the Russian government and\/or the international community officially declare a state of civil war.\n\nThe market will resolve as \"No\" if these conditions are not met on or before July 14, 2023.\n\nIn the case of conflicting reports or ambiguity about the state of affairs, the market may extend the resolution date to gather more information.

On average, the ship went down with four days-worth of oxygen on Sunday. The submersible has enough oxygen to last until 7am-midday Thursday.\n\nFactors such as oxygen levels, intense water pressure, and the remoteness of the area make the search difficult. \n\n The wreckage of the Titanic is also located at a depth of 13,000 feet \u2014 a point too deep for typical U.S. Navy subs \u2014 which typically go down to 2,000 or 3,000 feet \u2014 to descend to.\u00a0\n\nCanadian aircraft dropped a sonar buoy into the ocean listening for tapping or talking in an effort to pinpoint the submersible. Underwater sounds, with a banging noise every 30 minutes, were recently detected but sourcing efforts have not yielded results yet. \n\nFor context, when submarine crew face an underwater disaster and are unable to communicate with the surface they are advised to bang on their submersible's hull to be detected by sonar.\n\nSearch efforts have currently relocated to find the origin of the noises and more results are expected to arrive Thursday morning. Scientists warn that it's very difficult to discern the source of noises in the vast ocean and are analyzing all reported sounds in the search area.\n\nThe\u00a0Titan\u00a0has seven backup systems intended to return the vessel to surface in case of emergency, including a ballast that can be dropped, a balloon, and thrusters. Some of the backup systems are designed to work even if all aboard the submersible are unconscious; there are sandbags held by hooks that dissolve after a certain number of hours in the water and release the sandbags, letting the vessel float to the surface.\n\nThe fact that they didn't use one of the multiple methods to resurface indicates that they might either be stuck on something below the surface or that they experienced a structural failure and imploded.\n\nHowever, those aboard will know how to stretch their available air (as taught in Explorers Club training), and the cold environment will also depress metabolic body functions and decrease the air needed so there is a chance for a larger time window to help with search efforts.\n\nA remotely operated vehicle has recently discovered a \"debris field\" in the Titan vessel search area.\n\nFinal Update: The US Coast Guard confirms the Titan submersible imploded near the wreckage of the Titanic and has no survivors. May they rest in peace and well wishes are sent to the affected families.\"\n\nResolves YES if 1+ passengers are found and rescued in one week \u2014 up to June 23 (where we assume oxygen levels are extended beyond the current expected capacity of 70 hours)\n\nCase description paraphrased from live news reporting sources and forums:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/live-blog\/titanic-missing-submersible-live-updates-rcna90103\n\n[link preview]\n[Market creator] yasmeenbrain\n[Creation date] 06-20-2023\n[Closing data] 06-22-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Will Oceangate cease to operate before 2026?\n[Market description] Bankruptcy, dissolution and simmilar or anything that leads to them not conducting expeditions for longer than 1 year without visible progress being made counts as YES, regardless of name changes, acquisitions and such.

If it seems at all close on that user threshold, assume \"yes\".\n\nAttack must occur within calendar 2023, UTC.  Detection\/disclosure of attack need not be.\n\nThe architecture of the service must primarily or exclusively be around storage of encrypted user password vaults.  A generic cloud-storage \/ file management service (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive) does not count.  Password security\/strength checkers that incidentally use and store metadata\/previous breaches to evaluate secure passwords also don't count.  (ok I probably could have just said YouHaveBeenPwned\/Pwned Passwords, here).\n\nAt least one user password being displayed to the attacker and\/or exfiltrated as a data download (even if an encrypted version of that password) qualifies as a breach, provided it was by an external and unauthorized party.  (An employee absconding with a jilted lover's password file does not count). * see caveat in criterion #7.\n\nThe breach must be disclosed in a major media outlet, if not by the company directly.  If a publication is remotely questionable on this criteria, assume \"no\".\n\n(Added 2023-01-17) A second (through nth...) breach of LastPass does not count for this market.  It must be a non-LastPass service.  (That said, if some really wild edge case happens, like LastPass acquires a qualifying service and the breach is or seems to be entirely isolated to \/ affecting that service and its users, I reserve the right to go with YES after all.)\n\n(Added 2023-01-25) A bulk attack on the service, using credential stuffing or other techniques that don't exploit a bug or vulnerability, and that results in a widespread compromise of user accounts will count, if there are clear preventive measures that a password security service could have taken to prevent them.  For instance: \n\nlacking two-factor authentication\n\nnot checking or having weak requirements for password strength for vaults' master passwords\n\nnot having a means to stop or throttle bulk malicious traffic \n\nThese all feel like negligence on the part of the password security service.  \n\nCaveat: isolated reports of a single user's or targeted set of users' passwords being obtained through credential stuffing, phishing, social engineering, etc. (even someone high-profile like a government leader or celebrity technology leader) will not count, even if such an episode would otherwise pass criterion #4.  The rubric here will be \"does it seem like they were going for specific individuals or just every user account they could find?\"  \n\nIf an attack is discovered that started prior to 2023, but spans\/spanned into 2023, the attack will not count unless it is evident that the company knew about the initial attack, did no mitigation, and left themselves open to a second, distinct copycat event that did occur in 2023.  \n\nAdded 2023-01-25) This market will resolve YES earlier than the close date when a) there is a public report of a potentially qualifying breach and b) the company has either admitted or confirmed a sufficient number of details to pass all the criteria.  A news report purporting all sufficient details itself isn't enough, and I will allow the time needed for the impacted service to conduct their investigation to confirm.\n\n\nOtherwise, this market will close at midnight 2024 UTC.  The resolution will be four months later on May Day (lol) 2024 UTC.  (Based on four months between the attack and disclosure for LastPass).  If a suspected but unconfirmed breach is being reported by a service as of May Day, the market resolution will remain pending until that investigation concludes (or \"all conclude\" if there are, heaven forbid, multiple ongoing).\n\n(Added 2023-01-26) List of services that are being or had been considered as resolution candidates:\n\nNorton Lifelock \/ Norton Password Manager - NO\n\n\n[Market creator] Matt C.

The fact that several articles point to Norton not requiring 2FA, and (evidently) not using something like PwnedPasswords integration (or any password strength detection\u2026 ?),  and  not having any throttling or killswitch on bulk attacks means imo there is some negligence here on the part of a  password security service .

So, what I\u2019ll do here is add a criterion that a credential stuffing attack  will  count, because in my mind the burden of responsibility is on the service provider here.

Excellent, I had forgotten. We continue with a recap of the Sleeping Beauty problem. I have read many of these now and I can safely say that, of all of them, this one was written by Briggs. In Part 2, Rules for Halfers and Thirders, Briggs proposes a \"Halfer Rule\" which I'd summarize as \"ignore anthropic evidence\". In other words, never update probabilities based on \"de se\" evidence. If the coin has P(Heads) = 1\/2 in the view from nowhere, that is the P(Heads) I should believe in if I wake up as Beauty, regardless of whether I am told it is Monday. So this is a rule for the Double Halfer position which is not dependent on the Imaging Rule. It also seems a bit weird. If I am staring directly at a quantum coin, and it reads heads, that is maybe just \"de se\" evidence about which quantum branch I am in. So P(Heads) = 1\/2 despite the fact that I'm looking right at it. The paper does say earlier that there isn't a clear distinction between \"de se\" and \"de dicto\", so perhaps that is my confusion. The \"Thirder Rule\" is to pay attention to anthropic evidence. It's described as if it's SIA but this isn't an SIA vs SSA paper so I wouldn't weight that. No real justification at this stage of the paper, we're still just establishing the options. We go into a discussion of \"Weak Indifference\". It's helpful. As usual I am surprised by what other people consider counter-intuitive. My intuitions are probably messed up from excess sci-fi exposure. We also see an application to the Shooting Room Paradox (known on Manifold as Snake Eyes). You cannot simply have Weak Indifference over countably infinite perspectives. Not without some fancy math, at least. \"Weaker Indifference\" is \"Weak Indifference\" for people who distinguish \"risk\" from \"uncertainty\" and don't want to just have odds for everything. Meh. In part 3 we go onto Dutch Books. Stand back, we're going to try prediction markets. Helpfully there's some emphasis on how these arguments can be invalid due to \"deception\", which includes things we wouldn't think of as deception. Then finally we're on to the proof that Evidential Decision Theorists can be halfers. I'm excited, but ugh, this is some dense math. If I have this right, it's showing that everyone \"should bet at thirder odds\", whether they follow CDT or EDT. But EDT defines probability and calculates outcomes such that they need to have a halfer credence to bet at thirder odds. So no using Dutch Books to answer the Sleeping Beauty Problem. Then in part 4 Briggs does the whole exercise with Scoring Rules and comes to the same conclusion for the same reasons. I'm reading pages of math just to learn that there isn't an answer. This is why people hate mathematicians. Part 5, Stability. Help me part 5, you're my only hope. And actually yes, we get an intro to Technicolor Beauty and show that adding irrelevant information to the hypothetical makes everyone into a thirder. I wish that we had a worked Technicolor Beauty example of how an EDTist would assign credence and would bet, it's confusing. Then in part 6 Briggs shows her hand that this seems like evidence for the thirder position, and for CDT over EDT. This should maybe give slight pause to LessWrong readers who think that CDT is obviously wrong because of Newcomb's Problem. But probably some LessWrong-favored decision theory will also have Stability if anyone can make it concrete enough to apply to mythical princesses. Well, I started reading this paper because I wanted to find a halfer paper that was compelling and taken seriously by other philosophers. This isn't it! It's a thirder paper that is coy about it, just like Bayesian Beauty is all \"sure you can be a halfer or a thirder depending on your priors, it's just that the halfer priors are crazy town\". So far halfers have Lewis, who seems refuted (as does Elga), and Cozic, who seems ignored.\n---\n[Date]: 09-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  I've not really seen any good arguments other than 1\/2 or 1\/3.\n---\n[Date]: 08-31-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  the market should be at either 1\/2 or 1\/3.\n---\n[Date]: 08-29-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I think Lewis at least is answering the same question.

Apparently there's a whole different way to \"update your beliefs\" that nobody has mentioned to me before, aka \"The imaging rule\". I'm not quite sure what to do with it. Cozic says: Cozic points to a difference between \"revising\" our beliefs and \"updating\" our beliefs. Revising is when I get new information about an unchanging state. Updating is when I get information about a state change. Right now I know that it's Monday. Soon I plan to become unconscious, hallucinate wildly, and forget it all. Then I'll wake up to my alarm clock, and learn that it's Tuesday. The alarm clock won't \"revise\" my beliefs, because there's nothing wrong with my current belief that it's Monday. But it will let me \"update\" my belief when I notice that time has passed. For revising beliefs we follow Bayes' rule, everything's the normal way things work. And for updating beliefs apparently we can follow the Imaging Rule. Which is not justified in this paper as a reasonable rule to follow. Probably I could go read \"Probabilities of conditionals and conditional probabilities\" and \"Can bayes\u2019 rule be justified by cognitive rationality principles\" and get an answer. The rule is: So I have some beliefs about the distribution of possible worlds as I go to sleep on Monday, and when I wake up on Tuesday I get a new distribution of possible world that look very similar, except they are all Tuesday worlds. Like a movie multiverse, upon learning that the universe is constructed entirely of legos, we still expect to see Lego Spiderman fighting with Lego Doctor Octopus. I'm pretty skeptical, frankly. Instead, I think I go to sleep on Monday and I have a model of the world, and when I wake up I run the model forwards some fuzzy amount of time, and my beliefs about the present time get correspondingly fuzzier, and then the alarm clock says it's 7am and they get sharper again. If I was doing an Imaging Rule update, maybe the w that is closest to w0 is the world where it's still Monday but I set my alarm clock wrong. Isn't that a \"closer world\" than the one where the Earth is a few million kilometers further around the sun? But suppose we come to accept that the Imaging Rule, does that tell us what Sleeping Beauty's probability should be? Beauty goes to bed on Sunday, in Sunday world. She wakes up and she knows it is Monday or Tuesday, Heads or Tails. Which of the three worlds is closest to Sunday world? Is Monday or Tuesday a \"closer world\" to Sunday? Whatever \"closer\" means here. Cozic's answer wasn't very clear to me. I think he calculates as if there are two Sunday worlds, \"Sunday-that-will-be-Heads\" and \"Sunday-that-will-be-Tails\", and then distributes the weight of those two worlds and ends up as a halfer. If instead I imagine a single Sunday world, and I distribute its weight equally between the three possibilities (HM, TM, TT), I would end up a thirder. Cozic closes by explaining that he doesn't have a rigorous distinction to offer between revising and updating and further research is required. Reading between the lines it looks like a peer reviewer spotted a gaping hole in his argument and he acknowledged it and published what was left anyway. And then as far as I can tell he never wrote anything more about the topic. And it seems like imaging rules continue to receive very little attention by other philosophers. I suppose it's possible that the philosophical consensus ends up landing in the vicinity of this paper, but that doesn't look like the current trend.\n---\n[Date]: 08-14-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  academic philosophers at some time, no time limit, supermajority.

Beauty does not need to estimate the E2 probabilities by way of an update from E1 probabilities, because they are different events. He provides an inanimate version to further justify this.

So maybe I'll go read Groisman's paper and see if that is a better explanation of this point. There's a conflict between Bostrom's hybrid theory, which argues that the answer to SB is different if it is repeated vs if it is a single event, and Luna\/Groisman's Frequentist (I think?) approach that we calculate probabilities by repeating experiments a large number of times. If Bostrom is right then Frequentism cannot define probabilities for anthropic events.\n---\n[Date]: 08-03-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Review:  https:\/\/ora.ox.ac.uk\/objects\/uuid:44102720-3214-4515-ad86-57aa32c928c7\/ Bostrom has written clearer papers than this one. It's heavy going. Bostrom claims that neither 1\/2 nor 1\/3 are required by normal axioms of probability, and therefore looks to the consequences of each position to see if they might be counter-intuitive. I am not convinced at all by this approach. Anthropics is counter-intuitive, people routinely follow their intuitions into logical contradictions, and the universe is not required to be intuitive. In any case I can avoid \"presumptuous philosopher\" problems by admitting that I am fallible and may not have the right answer to anthropics. Instead, as a philosopher I would be eager for the experiment to go ahead and give us some solid evidence on philosophy. Then Bostrom proposes a hybrid model. Whatever I might think of his motivations for getting here, I am interested in a possible hybrid approach. This starts promisingly, where if we know that Beauty will be eventually told on Monday that it is Monday, we should model that as separate possible awoken states, for a total of five: I wish he went through the details of this and all its conclusions. Reading between the lines, I think Bostrom wants P(HEADS | H1 or T1 or T2) = 1\/2, and P(HEADS | H1M or T1M) = 1\/2. So the hybrid model is the \"double halfer\" position in this one-shot case. The last section is about long-run betting odds, which I very nearly discarded on the grounds that probabilities and betting odds can diverge. Fortunately I stuck with it, and the bets aren't load-carrying. It has a nice example of the case where Sleeping Beauty is put through the experiment two weeks in a row. In this case, P(Heads | awake and I don't know if it's Monday) = 5\/12. The paper concludes with a discussion of how you could run a dutch book against double-halfer Beauty, which Bostrom claims is an instance of probabilities and betting odds diverging. I am very comfortable with idea, perhaps too comfortable, so not really directed at me. Overall I think the paper does an okay job justifying how this hybrid model is a possible solution to the problem, but I'm completely unimpressed with Bostrom's attempt to justify it as a necessary solution. It's interesting that Bayesian Beauty used the same \"state expansion\" trick in a different way, and it makes me curious if one could expand the states in both ways at once to nail down the right answer.\n---\n[Date]: 07-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I don't want to tie you too much to your argument for a position you don't hold, but how much work do you think is done by the two days being identical? Eg, if during the day a coin is flipped to decide whether to play pool or snooker, does that mean that (if the coin results are diffeent) the days are not identical, and so in that variant the halfer you are simulating would agree that P(heads | awake) = 1\/3?\n---\n[Date]: 07-26-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: Review:  https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10670-019-00212-4  - Bayesian Beauty, Silvia Milano (2022). I really liked this paper. Especially compared to standard internet commentary! Refreshing to see both positions taken seriously and described charitably. I think it has moved me to a personal position where I'm more confident that the thirder position is most correct. Of course one paper does not indicate a consensus, and there's much more to read here. Section 2: The Problem, is in my view the highlight. In carefully describing the problem, Milano practically solves it, reducing it to a problem of priors. To use a LessWrong term, we need to have a prior on how \"reality fluid\" is distributed between Monday and Tuesday. Although this is framed in terms of temporal uncertainty, I'm pretty sure the whole thing works just as well for spatial uncertainty, which would finally provide some kind of principled argument for approaches to anthropic reasoning. Things I have read prior to this have mostly been people arguing over which bullets are worse to bite, and none of that sways me. The universe doesn't care if the Doomsday Argument hurts my feelings. In Section 3: Solution, she pulls the trigger on arguing for the thirder position based on the  idea that Monday and Tuesday are both equally likely via the Principle of Indifference. I'm sure many would regard this is \"just common sense\" or the like, but I appreciate the dedication to rigorous argument. On the other hand, halfers need to have the prior P(Monday | Heads) = 1. Making this concrete, if Prince Charming tells halfer Sleeping Beauty that he had painted a picture of her sleeping on Tuesday, Beauty would not believe him, because P(Tuesday AND Heads) = 0. She is also completely indifferent to her sleeping conditions, because P(Awake) = 1. These are weird priors. On the other hand, we can construct variations on Sleeping Beauty where this is not such a weird prior. If the entire universe is paused (or destroyed) while Sleeping Beauty is asleep on Tuesday, then P(Tuesday & Heads)=0 seems valid. A solipsist philosophical stance (and an especially deep sleep) would do the same. Section 4: Matters of Principle, reassures me that Sleeping Beauty (and anthropic problems generally) don't in fact break the whole of probability. Less exciting, but thank you anyway. The universe is weird enough already. Section 5: Bets and Odds, is targeted at a different audience to me. Since betting in \"will the probability of this market go below 10%?\" and similar markets, I've come to the conclusion that for non-Cartesian agents like myself, credences and betting odds frequently come apart. But those who differ will find value. This is also the section where Evidential Decision Theory briefly rears its head. I will defer judgment on that until I read the referenced paper. I don't have much credence in EDT. I'm also thinking that the market refers to an \"ideal epistemic agent\", whereas decision theory is about actions, so it may not apply. Thanks to   for the citation. I've added it to the description.\n---\n[Date]: 07-26-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]:  I'm not entirely clear on your point. I think the Bayesian Beauty paper takes careful pains to show how both halfer positions can be compatible with standard probability axioms, including Conditionalization and Reflection, with an unusual prior - that P(Monday | Heads) = 1. A footnote gives a similar answer for the \"double halfer\" position. Now, Milano thinks this is a bad prior, citing the Principle of Indifference: Practically speaking I think \u03b1=1 is also a bad prior for humility reasons. At least if I have an incorrect prior of \u03b1=0.5 I can update it based on evidence. But it is a valid prior in principle, and we could construct slightly different thought experiments where it is true. Here is another quote from Milano to that point: More generally, I wouldn't take a single 2022 paper as indicating a mathematical consensus on any controversial point. It is a great paper, though, I added it to the description above.\n---\n[Date]: 07-25-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]:  for what it's worth I thought section 2 (problem) was very valuable.

This collapses to regular Bayes in normal scenarios. The forgetting argument is a good way of avoiding that, though.

Otherwise they might only tell you that if you are H1, for example. I think this is the problem of reference class selection, which I read favors SIA but I don't yet understand why. If the reference class is \"person who is woken up and told that they are not H3 or T3\" then people like this exist in both branches of the universe, so SSA makes no anthropic update, and claims that p(heads) is 50%. Similarly for the reference class \"person who is woken up and told they are H3 or T3\", p(heads) is 50%. I'm not sure how this interacts with the normal Bayes update rule. I think it would need to be modified. This is consistent with my intuition that SSA observers experience a weird future and SIA observers experience a weird past.\n---\n[Date]: 07-22-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: Variant: Prince Charming rolls a million-sided dice.

I think they would bet differently for utilons. If there is an opportunity to eat chocolate after the interview, before getting the amnesiac, but only for one coin flip result, thirder would prefer to get chocolate on tails.

Recapturing the electricity used to trigger the fusion reaction, recharging the device's magnets.\n\nConnected the fusion generator to a power grid in Washington, delivering at least 50 megawatts of fusion-generated electricity to Microsoft, as outlined in their power purchase agreement.\n\nDemonstrated a net energy gain from the fusion generator, meaning that the energy produced through fusion is greater than the energy input required to initiate and sustain the fusion reaction.\n\nThe resolution of this question will be based on publicly available evidence, such as press releases, independent expert assessments, technical publications, and regulatory approvals, that confirms Helion Energy's achievement of the above criteria by the specified deadline.\n\nI will use my discretion when resolving this question, possibly in consultation with experts, to ensure that the criteria are met, and that Helion Energy has successfully held up their end of the deal by providing the promised amount of electricity via fusion energy before January 1st, 2029.\n[Market creator] Matthew Barnett\n[Creation date] 05-10-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2029\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n"],"203":["[Market title] Will a federal court grant Mike Pence relief from the special council supeona under the Speech and Debate clause of the constitution?\n[Market description] Pence is claiming protection from forced testimony explicitly reserved for Senators and Representatives.

See my runthrough of recent public attempts on recent presidents and how I would have adjudicated them in the comments.\n\nA few potential edge cases, and how I plan to adjudicate them if they come up:\n\n1. Murder of a politician, with an unshared\/unknown motive. If a politician is knifed by a junkie walking down a street that doesn't resolve \"yes\", but if a politician is found murdered I'll close the question and, in the absence of a likely motive which is unrelated to their political office, I'll resolve \"yes\" after a reasonable interval. Burden of proof will be on the \"no\" votes to show that it was not an assassination in this case.\n\n2. Some hopelessly crazy person who thought they were trying to assassinate a politician but who never could have in a million years will be resolved as \"yes\" if charges are brought which are directly related to the attempt; not resolved otherwise. Edit: This question won't resolve \"yes\" for any plot, no matter how intricate, unless the attempted assassination process was actually begun.\n\n3. The questions will close at the end of December if it hasn't resolved \"yes\" before then, but I'll hold off for a few weeks to make sure something late didn't get missed, or longer if there's still an ambiguous case pending.\n\nOther edge cases will be resolved in the spirit of these general guidelines.

All the rest: No. Mail doesn't get opened by the president, flipping the limo would have been impossible and ineffective, and so on. None of the rest of these are credible threats. Obama: April 2009 yes Nov 2011 no, random fire sprayed at the building is not a credible threat against a president. 0% chance of success, like the ricin stuff. All others were plots or mail attacks. Mail attacks have a 0% chance of success, and are not serious.  I'd adjudicate all of these as \"No\" except Sandford 2016 and April 2009.

In the unlikely event that no accurate seismic data is available after a certain point (e.g. if all seismic data ceases being reported after 2028), this market resolves according to the most recent data available.\n\nWashington state experiences several earthquakes per day on average (between July 1 and July 6, 41 earthquakes were recorded in and around the state) - though almost all are too far weak to be noticed by anything other than seismological equipment (the aformentioned 41 earthquakes ranged from magnitude 0.0 to magnitude 2.8). Stronger earthquakes do happen, however, and Washington sits just east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which tends to rupture violently in megathrust events every few hundred years.

The US keeps gaining jobs, and unemployment remains near historic lows. Inflation is declining, as are gas prices. Yet there is striking uniformity among economists and business executives that a recession is incoming.\n\n\nWhat gives? Not the Federal Reserve, which has shown no sign that it is ready to significantly moderate interest rate increases, as it seeks to curb spending and investment and tame inflation. Pulling that off without thrusting the US into a recession would require orchestrating the kind of soft landing for the economy that the Fed hasn\u2019t pulled off since 1994, as my Vox colleague Madeleine Ngo wrote recently. Every part of the economy that is vulnerable to high interest rates \u2014 home purchases, manufacturing output, retail sales \u2014 is already slumping.\n\n\nPut the current data and the historical analogies together and it\u2019s hard to believe that the US won\u2019t avoid at least a mild recession next year, especially since economic decision-makers are all basically acting as though one is imminent. \n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 01-01-2024\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n","[Market title] Did the US officially enter a recession in 2022?

The base model was quite good at this and was able to produce content of toxic nature, examples of which can be found in the technical report.  A possible harm of releasing the base model, they say, is the potential use of the model by nation states to produce propaganda. They further say that OpenAI did lots of testing to reduce this capability in the chat models.  For example, So far, most of the reports are focused on non-text AI generated content such as deepfakes or videos or voice, which seems in line with the type of content that most humans respond to.

I'm fairly confident that the traders of the market collectively come to a decent estimate of the true market probability in a market of this size, and if there was a clear-cut evidence for yes, as you claim, then the market's output should reflect that (if prediction markets work). Although I'll eventually evaluate all evidence presented to the market, to determine the resolution, asking me to speed run that process should require something compelling. If you were to ask me to evaluate just 1 evidence, what would it be? I can do that fairly quickly. As for the traders, a market could be 10x this markets size, and it wouldn't make a dent in my portfolio, so I don't really think about that.\n---\n[Date]: 11-13-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Consider this analogy: We have a system, and given an input to the system, we get as output the probability that system assigns to a binary classification task (Ex: Dog or not dog, cat or not cat, etc). In this case, the classification task is the market's resolution. The heuristics estimators or neurons that determine the output of the system are the traders, with some being well calibrated heuristic estimators and others noisy. Upon being presented with an input (read as evidence), the \"neurons\" or \"heuristic estimators\" or \"traders\" of the system (market) update their weights and we get a new output probability. 50% is when the model is roughly making a random guess.  Now the following set of inputs is presented to the system:  Input 1: A very hazy picture of a dog Output: 49% chance of a dog -> labeled as \"not a dog\". Input 2: A slightly less hazy picture of a dog Output: 51% chance of a dog -> labeled as \"dog\". Input 3: A fairly clear picture of a dog Output: 81% chance of a dog -> labeled as \"dog\". All you can see are the probabilities that the model is outputting, not the images. Given that, for which of the three outputs, you'd choose to look at the input, if you had to choose one?\n---\n[Date]: 11-13-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  Feel free to share, I'm sure market traders are capable of evaluating the evidence just as well, and updating the market % based on that.

(Hand 4)\n[Market description] This is the central place for info for this hand. New questions will be posted here as we go.\n\nThis question resolves to the winner(s) equally at the end of the hand. Note that bets here don't determine the result of the game. Go to the current round's question for that.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nThe River, 5 players left. No one pushed the minimum last time so the current minimum is 12 mana.\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Stralor\/manifold-plays-poker-the-river-hand-fca70e818675)The Audience\n\nPoor Audience got eliminated in the Deal (again)\n\n9 of spades, 4 of hearts\n\nLet's play a variation on poker! Like all the decent games of poker, this will be a lot about leveraging luck with strategy and mind games; a perfect match for a place about predictions imo.\n\nWe're playing a variation based on Texas Hold 'Em specially designed for working on Manifold over a series of markets, but everyone can participate and bet even if they're not given a hand.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nPlayers who get a hand are welcome to share it, or team up, bluff, obfuscate, and misdirect, whether on the questions, over discord, or wherever they see fit. They're also welcome to bet for or against their opponents!\n\nOnce everyone has their hand, I'll make a general question about \"who will win\" that will track the status of the game, and then rapid (~1 day) questions for each of the four rounds of betting.\n\nEach player must commit a certain amount of mana on YES on themselves each round to advance to the next stage, as indicated by the round's trading history, otherwise they fold. Their commitment is the net of YES mana spent minus NO mana spent on themselves. This minimum equals half the lowest buy-in position that got into the game. This hand, that starts at 3.\n\nIf any player commits double or more than the minimum in any round, the minimum is doubled in all future rounds. i.e.: if the minimum mana to play is 20 and one or more people commit 40+, all future rounds have a minimum of 40, unless they get doubled further.\n\nThe Audience Hand works exactly like personal hands, except it:\n\nis publicly visible\n\ndoesn't have to buy in\n\nmust have twice the minimum, using bets from all bettors, to advance\n\nThe round questions resolve at the end of the game to the winner(s), equally.\n\nIf two or more players stick it out to the end I'll reveal their hands, announce the winner, and resolve all the remaining questions accordingly.\n\nIf for whatever reason every player folds at any stage, the win goes to the player who held the highest bet on themselves in the previous round.\n\nThis hand is the first in a short tournament series. There are several ways to score points in the tournament (even if you don't get a hand).\n\nAs you might have noticed, the rules of this special variant allow for mismatched bets by players, so feel free to jump in even if you're intimidated by a whale in the water! They can do their thing, profit by playing market dynamics, and you can still come out on top :) Admins and Manifold staff also have no inherent advantage, so don't be shy!\n\nAs I'll know all of the cards, I won't be betting or playing in the rounds, and I cannot be bribed to reveal other players' information or tilt in your favor. My house cut is simply the trader bonuses on any questions I make for this, though I'll accept tips for my role as dealer if you're so inclined.\n\nOf course, side markets are welcome. Feel free to add them to the Manifold Plays Poker group and comment them here for shared visibility, and they'll count for the tournament!\n\n[markets](https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Dilon\/manifold-plays-poker-do-i-have-an-a)(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Fion\/will-the-winning-hand-in-manifold-p)\n[Market creator] Pat Scott\ud83e\ude74\n[Creation date] 07-29-2023\n[Closing data] 08-02-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: NEW HAND IS A GOOO new buy-in method! preset minimums! a delicious menu of cheats for purchase!\n---\n[Date]: 08-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: updating tournament points. when the last extra meta questions are resolved, I'll calculate the tourney points for meta question profit :)\n---\n[Date]: 08-02-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: As Dilon didn't bet quite enough to enter the showdown, the final is between A, Christopher, and Jason: A has two pairs, 4s and Js with a K kicker Christopher also has two pairs, 3s and Js (also with a K kicker) Jason ALSO has two pairs, 5s and Js, which is the highest! @Jason  wins!\n---\n[Date]: 08-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  good to know! thanks Alex\n---\n[Date]: 08-01-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I've also just noticed that   got folded because of zero bets on the Turn, which makes me think we both messed up.

Like all the decent games of poker, this will be a lot about leveraging luck with strategy and mind games; a perfect match for a place about predictions imo.\n\nWe're playing a variation based on Texas Hold 'Em specially designed for working on Manifold over a series of markets, but everyone can participate and bet even if they don't buy a hand. See \"How It Works\" below for more info.\n\nThis is the central place for info for this hand. New questions will be posted here as we go.\n\nThis question resolves to the winner(s) equally at the end of the hand. Note that bets here don't determine the result of the game. Go to the current round's question for that.\n\nCurrent Status\n\nThe River, heads up (with the possibility of resurrection). The minimum is 40.\n\n[image]6 of diamonds, 3 of hearts, 7 of diamonds, 6 of hearts, and 3 of clubs showing on the board.\n\n(https:\/\/manifold.markets\/embed\/Stralor\/manifold-plays-poker-the-river-hand-223b58db8e3d)The Audience\n\nEliminated in the Flop.\n\nQueen of Hearts, 2 of Hearts\n\nCheats\n\nIn this hand players and audience members can pay to do \"cheats\".\n\nCheats can be bought by adding a subsidy in the current betting round and commenting what cheat you'd like or sending me a managram with the same info, and all cheats count towards earning an extra tournament point for the hand, which is earned at 100 mana spent towards the prize pool. I'll respond with the answer privately, if it involves cards. Managrams will be added to a prize pool given to the winner(s) at the end.\n\nI will try to be timely in granting your cheat, but may take up to 12 hours to respond (so plan your cheats accordingly).\n\nMenu ~\n\n20 mana - see a card you haven't seen yet from a random player's current hand (not told which, can have been eliminated or unclaimed), up to 3 times\n\n50 mana - call a specific card and ask me if it's in the game\n\n50 mana - pair with another player, steal 25% of their resolution percent if they win, give them 25% of yours if you win. each player can be in one pair\n\n100 mana - resurrect your hand after folding\n\n100 mana - draw a replacement hand or join late, while supplies last. only 13 hands will be drawn (12 + the Audience), so you'll be grabbing one that wasn't claimed\n\nHow It Works\n\nYou can get a hand here before the game starts by paying the subsidy to add yourself to the list. Limited to the first 12 players (though I don't expect to have that many).\n\nPlayers who get a hand are welcome to share it, or team up, bluff, obfuscate, and misdirect, whether on the questions, over discord, or wherever they see fit. They're also welcome to bet for or against their opponents!\n\nAfter we fill up or a couple of days, I'll kick off the game with the first of the rapid (~1 day) questions for each of the four rounds of betting (Deal, Flop, Turn, River).\n\nEach player must commit a certain amount of mana on YES on themselves each round to advance to the next stage, as indicated by the round's trading history, otherwise they fold. Their commitment is the net of YES mana spent on themselves minus NO mana spent on themselves. This minimum starts at 10 mana for the Deal.\n\nIf any player commits double or more than the minimum in any round, the minimum is doubled in all future rounds. i.e.: if the minimum mana to advance in a round is 20 and one or more people commit 40+, all future rounds have a minimum of 40, unless they get doubled further.\n\nThe Audience Hand works exactly like personal hands, except it:\n\nis publicly visible\n\nwas bought in by me\n\nadvances by counting only YES bets on it, but needs double the minimum\n\nThe round questions resolve at the end of the game to the winner(s), equally.\n\nIf two or more players stick it out to the end I'll reveal their hands, announce the winner(s), and resolve all the remaining questions accordingly.\n\nIf for whatever reason every player folds at any stage, the win goes to the player who held the highest bet on themselves in the previous round.\n\nThis hand is part of a short tournament series. There are several ways to score points in the tournament (even if you don't get a hand).\n\nAs you might have noticed, the rules of this special variant allow for mismatched bets by players, so feel free to jump in even if you're intimidated by a whale in the water! They can do their thing, profit by playing market dynamics, and you can still come out on top :) Admins and Manifold staff also have no inherent advantage, so don't be shy!\n\nAs I'll know all of the cards, I won't be betting or playing in the rounds, and I cannot be bribed to reveal other players' information or tilt in your favor except with official cheats. My house cut is simply the trader bonuses on any questions I make for this, though I'll accept tips for my role as dealer if you're so inclined.\n\nOf course, side markets are welcome. Feel free to add them to the Manifold Plays Poker group and comment them here for shared visibility, and they'll count for the tournament!\n\nSide markets:\n\n@\/Jason\/manifold-plays-poker-hand-5-how-man \n\n@\/Stralor\/who-will-win-place-and-show-in-hand-38e051c645e7 \n\n@\/Stralor\/will-the-audience-make-it-to-the-fl \n\n@\/Stralor\/will-the-winning-hand-in-hand-5-of \n\n@\/ChristopherRandles\/manifold-plays-poker-hand-5-will-wi \n[Market creator] Pat Scott\ud83e\ude74\n[Creation date] 08-02-2023\n[Closing data] 08-08-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  yeah, that's more or less what it was before I was brainstorming added time. even if +12 hours is a little dicey for some folks with schedules, it still feels somewhat more fair. but Jason is right, I'll keep chewing on it\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  person who does replace card chooses which to replace, but the replacement card is \"drawn\" from the deck (will be pre-drawn and given in order, like everything else)\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  spread is flop + turn + river; I'll only tell you \"the card is (not) in the game\", doesn't count any unclaimed cards incl late join\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  maybe I could add 12 hours to a round timer if a resurrection happens, but this might cut stuff close to me needing to get on a plane. this still seems like the right move, tbh. then a player wouldn't needd to worry about end time\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  hmm I'm not sure how \"at least 12 hours before end of game\" plays out with random close times. 12h before maximum close time? tough to balance \"I missed a round of betting and need an opportunity window to resurrect\" vs. \"other players need a chance to respond to the resurrection\"\n---\n[Date]: 08-10-2023\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  jotted down some notes, thinking I might make these changes: - resurrection, 100 mana, immediate upon purchase and declaration at least 12 hours before end of game, only get half of resolution (other half spread out; so in 2 split resurrectee gets 25% other gets 75%, in 1st 50% while 2nd gets 50%, modified further by pairings, etc.), still counts for full tourney points - late join, 75 mana + buy-in, immediate upon purchase and declaration at least 12 hours before end of game (though I might take a bit to respond and give the hand), 1x available - (new) replace a card in hand, 50 mana, random new card, old card declared publicly, 3x available - call-a-card only returns answer from spread and current hands at time of purchase (so may change if a late join\/ card replace happens)\n---\n[Date]: 08-09-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  good ideas!\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: HAND 6 \ud83e\udd73 \ud83e\udd73  Last chance for tourney points, and we're doing CHAOS mode\n---\n[Date]: 08-08-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  We'll leave this an open question for now.

These questions are rapid, each round will only last about a day. I will close the River by hand at an undetermined time to avoid snipe eliminations.\n\nEach player must hold a certain amount of YES shares on their own Hand, Flop, Turn, and River questions at close of the betting round to have a chance to advance to the next stage. This self-position is called their \"wager\".\n\nThe player with the 4th\/3rd\/2nd\/1st highest wager in the round is called the Pivot Player (Hand\/Flop\/Turn\/River). If the player who would be the Pivot doesn't have a positive wager, the role moves to the lowest-standing player who does.\n\nEach player needs to wager \u2265 1\/2 of the Pivot Player's wager to advance, otherwise they fold.\n\nA player's questions will resolve NO if they fold, NO if they lose, and YES if they win. They can also resolve PROB if the end of the game is a split (75% for a two-way split, 66% for a three-way, 50% if it's somehow a four-way).\n\nIf two or more players stick it out to the end I'll reveal their hands, announce the winner, and resolve all the remaining questions accordingly.\n\nIf for whatever reason every player folds at any stage, the win goes to the player who held the highest YES wager on the previous round.\n\nAs you might have noticed, the rules of this special variant allow for mismatched bets by players, so feel free to jump in even if you're intimidated by a whale in the water!

At the time, the difficulty level was beyond my ability, but it's been on my mind ever since. I'd like to finally meet this mountain tomorrow. \n\nThe standard Table Mountain Trail is 10.7 miles with 4,146 feet of elevation gain. The harder Table Mountain Face Trail shortens the mileage to 8.2 miles. \n\nInstead, I'd like to approach from the Wyoming side of the Teton Range starting from String Lake, hiking up Cascade Canyon, crossing Hurricane Pass, summiting Table Mountain, and descending the Face Trail to exit on the Idaho side. \n\n[image]The red and yellow sections exist as trails on Alltrails, but the blue section doesn't. There doesn't seem to be any information online, so traversing that unknown 1.3 miles is my biggest concern. It could be impassable. Snow is also a risk factor. \n\n[image]There's no good reason to hike to Table Mountain the hard way (and there's probably a good reason why this route doesn't exist on Alltrails), except to experience the mountains more fully. I've gone the length and height of the Teton Range (by backpacking 35 miles along the Teton Crest Trail and climbing 7,043 feet up Grand Teton), and now I have a chance to walk the width.\n\nWill I summit Table Mountain via this route? \n\n[image]Resolved to yes! The hike totaled 18 miles because navigating through that blue section was so ambiguous. The first 9 miles flew by in four hours, then that single offtrail mile took four hours. Now I know why no trail exists \u2014 that side of the mountain requires scrambling straight up crumbling scree at a 60-degree incline. The mountain slides under every step. But the views were breathtaking! \n\n[image]There's a sign at the exit saying, \"Face Trail, trail not maintained, very steep, not recommended\" but it turned out to be fine. Nice, even! I'm grateful for the trail builders who put in a real trail and extra grateful for the friends who met me at the end with Thai takeout. \n[Market creator] Alice\n[Creation date] 09-25-2022\n[Closing data] 09-26-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-26-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Thanks, Daniel!

Now that I've reached my goal of climbing the Grand, will I maintain my fitness any longer? \n\nI can be very driven, obsessive even, in pursuing goals. But in the absence of a goal to dedicate myself to, is there any reason to suffer, I mean, exercise? Other than this anomaly of a year, I never exercise. I have no intention of ever doing hill sprints again unless I'm being chased by a moose.\n\nIt's ambiguous how I'd determine whether I'm maintaining equal or greater fitness. Appearance and weight are irrelevant; what matters to me is ability. When I was training I tracked metrics I needed to hit, like time per thousand feet of elevation gain. Maybe my friends can ask to hike at any time and put me on the spot, so I don't have time to prepare last-minute?

As Millhiser notes, there are six Republican appointees on the Court today, all by presidents opposed to affirmative action and all reared in a conservative legal movement where opposition to the policy is taken for granted. Even the most comparatively moderate of them, Chief Justice John Roberts, is famously hostile to considering race in attempts to address past discrimination.\n\n\nThe reason I\u2019m not more confident is due to a nuance Millhiser noted, which is that Roberts appeared open to racial preferences at military academies, noting the federal government\u2019s argument that the military needs a diverse officer corps to succeed. If such a carve-out is included in the ultimate ruling, my prediction here will be wrong: I\u2019m predicting they\u2019ll strike down affirmative action across the board at public or publicly funded institutions. \n\n(Vox)\n\n[markets]Resolves according to Vox Future Perfect's judgment at the end of the year.\n[Market creator] arae\n[Creation date] 01-09-2023\n[Closing data] 09-27-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-27-2023\n[Likes] 2\n[Text]: ok I'll resolve this \u2014 if it ends up being judged in the end of year writeup, we can reresolve, but that seems unlikely to me\n---\n[Date]: 09-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  is there public evidence that he thinks it's wrong?\n---\n[Date]: 09-23-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Why?

The phrase \"yes, white privilege exists; it's fantastic, and we'd like more of it, thanks.\" makes it pretty clear to me that this viewpoint can reasonably be called white supremacy. That's all irrelevant though, because this was a comment by someone completely unrelated to Scott, and the only thing Scott is accused of is not deleting it fast enough.

It seems fairly clear that Scott believes white people are on average more intelligent than black people, and that this is due in part to genetics. Scott also believes the world would be a better place if more intelligent people were in charge of important decisions. I agree this approaches traditional definitions of white supremacy, but it misses some very important aspects. As far as I can tell: In short, a world ruled by Scott does not seem like it would be a world where white people lead noticeably happier or more privileged lives than black people. If given the technology to do so, their ideal world would likely involve helping people of all races to be cognitive equals. If that technology is not available, it would likely include policies such as UBI and a strong educational system that attempt to mitigate any disadvantages caused by differences in intelligence. This does not resemble what I think of when I hear the term \"white supremacy\", nor does it seem like what most people think of when they hear the term. I remain open to counterarguments!

The reasoning given was: I think this person has misunderstood the article. The point (as I understand it) was to point out how the word \"racism\" is often used in mutually-contradictory ways, and tends to confuse discussion about what things are good or bad. (Similar to how a lot of people here disagree about what \"white supremacy\" means.) Moreover, the article spends a significant fraction of its length advocating  against  a policy that led to people being declined for a job due only to their race. It explains how calling certain behavior \"racist\" provably lead to systematically worse outcomes for black people, and explains an alternative system that would lead to better outcomes for black people.  Explaining how our current societal structure systematically disadvantages black people and investigating ways to remove that systemic oppression is pretty much the modern definition of \"antiracism\", so I have a really hard time seeing how an article that's doing exactly that could be Scott advocating for white supremacy. I admit I only skimmed the article (it was quite long), so if I missed something important please let me know.\n---\n[Date]: 12-30-2022\n[Likes] 0\n[Text]:  Whoops, the \"above disclaimer\" wasn't actually above, I was thinking of something I had written on discord.\n---\n[Date]: 12-30-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  That would certainly make them a white supremacist (subject to the above disclaimer).

I suspect most value systems towards animals are based mostly on emotional attachment, aesthetics, and usefulness. People care more about their own dog than they do a stray, even if they're the same species. People care more about butterflies than moths, not due to a belief in the supremacy of butterfly DNA, but just because they're prettier. People care more about horses than they do cows, not because horses are smarter, but because horses are primarily useful alive while cows are primarily useful dead. Not to mention the environmental approaches where the value of an individual animal is proportional to how close that species is to going extinct. (Though I do think cognitivism plays a role, as in the care shown towards dolphins.)\n---\n[Date]: 12-29-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  Yes, that's also true, as I mentioned below. However I do need to treat very strong correlations as supremacy so that one can't avoid the \"white supremacy\" label just by talking about a proxy measure. If someone is an IQ supremacist and also believes that 99% of white people are smarter than all black people, I'd still call that white supremacy, even if they'd treat the 1% of smarter black people well.\n---\n[Date]: 12-29-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]: I haven't finished reading through all the material posted yet, but I'm working on it. It looks like the only angle that the \"yes Scott is a white supremacist\" people are taking is that of his support for racial differences in IQ, so let me try to clear some things up about that. The term \"white supremacy\" is generally used as referring to a normative claim, not a factual one. From Wikipedia: Whether or not IQ differences exist between races is a factual claim, so on its own, that belief is not white supremacy any more than the belief that women tend to wear more earrings is \"female supremacy\". Where it becomes white supremacy is when it's coupled with a normative claim like \"and therefore black people are less deserving of happiness\". The reason why \"white people are smarter than black people\" is seen as a discriminatory statement is because there's an assumed \"and smarter people deserve better treatment\" normative claim going along with it. This assumption is usually taken for granted in these discussions, and nobody mentions it explicitly. When someone says \"I want black people to have fair treatment, therefore I must believe that they're equally intelligent to white people\", that statement is predicated on the unspoken belief that less intelligent people should be treated badly. I think it's true that a lot of people have this belief, so it's often correct to make that assumption about their underlying belief structure. From the right side of the political spectrum it generally comes in the form of libertarian \"poor people deserve their lot in life because they were too dumb to make money successfully\" arguments, while from the left it generally comes from elitist \"stupid people deserve deserve to be ridiculed because they were too dumb to get through college\" statements. In both cases this is just IQ supremacy, and when you're in a culture that takes IQ supremacy as a given, it's fine to not explicitly state that assumption. Scott's blog (and general worldview) is largely about clearly stating what assumptions do or do not hold and making those things explicit, and evaluating each piece of the argument in isolation to see whether it holds up under scrutiny. In that context, the statement \"white people are smarter than black people\" just means exactly what it says. Claiming that it's white supremacy would be akin to claiming that the statement \"black people are more resistant to sunburn\" is black supremacy; it's just a factual statement, and nobody is saying that one's resistance to sunburn determines one's moral worth as a person. So the question is, does Scott actually believe that someone's IQ has a large impact on their moral worth? (I need to call out \"a large impact\", because most humans hold some variation of this belief for small impacts. Huge numbers of humans believe that the lives of non-human animals are less important than the lives of humans due to their lower intelligence. But the difference in intelligence between a smart human and a dumb human is still much smaller than the difference in intelligence between a dumb human and a cow.) As far as I can tell, Scott has not expressed any opinions similar to that, nor done anything that seems likely to lead towards such a world. They have in fact done the opposite, advocating for UBI and other policies to fight systemic poverty. (Which disproportionally impacts both black people and less intelligent people.) The only link I saw from someone trying to claim otherwise was Scott's defense of meritocracy, but they clearly state in that article that they  do not  believe that less capable\/intelligent people are deserving of a less happy life, but rather than the world would be a better place if it were run by more capable people,  including for the less intelligent people . I think the most promising line of argument for the \"yes Scott is racist\" crowd would be to find me some evidence showing that Scott's professed beliefs there are false, and that Scott actually does think that smarter people deserve better treatment, and the \"no we should just put them in charge of things because they're good at it\" is a cover for that.\n---\n[Date]: 12-28-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I have PM'd you a tip for that comment. :)\n---\n[Date]: 12-28-2022\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]: https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2017\/8\/12\/16138326\/aclu-charlottesville-protests-racism\n---\n[Date]: 12-28-2022\n[Likes] 1\n[Text]:  No.\n---\n[Date]: 12-28-2022\n[Likes] 4\n[Text]:  You've provided a link to a post where Scott  compliments  an article written  against  racism. and says nothing about any object-level arguments within that post.

However, I also don't want to let someone argue for a policy that really is white supremacy under the hood just by finding some other quality that happens to be extremely well-correlated with it, like the albedo of your eyelid.

That said, there are a few topicality details that sway me in favor of not including digital upload for positive resolution. Mainly that wording in the original question and description softly implies tangible-body restoration. \"brought back to life\", \"restored subject must be awake\", \"live for at least one month\". While that language could feasibly apply to a digital restoration, if another market creator wrote the question & I was betting on their market, I would assume they were not referring to digital upload in the market creation.  Apologies that the market was unclear \/ if you bet under that lack of clarity. I would be open to refunding you Mana that you realistically lost if that would be helpful.

(This means that the revived person must behave nearly identically to the person they were before the preservation, with the same memories, personality, etc. Minor changes such as having forgotten the short-term memories created right before their death are fine. What matters is whether people who knew them before their death would reasonably say \"yup, that's Bob\". Philosophical arguments that they're not the \"same person\" due to the cessation of brain activity or being made out of different molecules are irrelevant.)\n\nIf the state of science and technology advances to the point where we can state without any doubt whatsoever that there is not enough information left in those preserved brains to revive someone who could reasonably be called the same person, or that the information does exist but fundamental laws of physics prevent us from accessing it or using it to recreate the person, this market resolves to NO.\n\nIf all preserved brains that exist as of market creation in the top 10% of preservation quality are destroyed, this resolves N\/A.

You can find more about them on their about page: https:\/\/www.alcor.org\/about\/\n\nA classic critique of cryonics is that the organizations may face bankruptcy, and be forced to thaw their patients. This question resolves to YES if Alcor goes bankrupt before any of their patients are revived. Otherwise, it resolves to NO.\n\nYou can find more specific information about the history of brain preservation on this page by Metaculite Mati Roy: https:\/\/timelines.issarice.com\/wiki\/Timeline_of_brain_preservation\n\nLessWrong user Froolow wrote a financial analysis of Alcor: https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/B8Lu238n4ReCcebhP\/how-long-will-alcor-be-around\n\nSee also this question for the Cryonics Insitute: https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/6616\/cryonics-institute-to-go-bankrupt\/\n\nJeff Kaufman maintains a spreadsheet of cryonics probability estimates, which you can find on this page: https:\/\/www.jefftk.com\/p\/more-cryonics-probability-estimates\n\nFor the purpose of this question, a \"patient\" is a human body or brain that is being stored by a cryonics organization in the expectation of future revival. The revival of a patient at Alcor requires these two conditions.\n\nThe patient must be either restored to normal physiological health or emulated on a computer, as determined by credible media.\n\nThe patient must have been signed up with Alcor before their deanimation (or legal death), and must have been preserved at Alcor facilities for at least 90% of the duration of their preservation.\n\nAlcor is said to go bankrupt if credible media reports that they have gone banrkupt, and no credible contradiction of this claim is made by Alcor staff within one year of any report.\n\nFine print: By its nature, this question's resolution will be pending indefinitely in the case that Alcor exists and has not gone bankrupt. If the Alcor ceases to exist, but not due to bankruptcy, then this question resolves to N\/A. If Alcor changes its name, the new organization is used for resolution as if there was no name change. If Alcor merges into another organization, the resulting merged organization is used for resolution.

I often hit Command-Q (and usually I hit the Q like ten times to be more emphatic, which I've been mocked for) before closing my computer.\n\nAnyway, I've been curious to try out the many-tabs lifestyle that most other people seem to use. It also seems like a good time for me, since I have various projects I'm sort of working on, and this may lower friction towards making small changes! However, it's also possible the many tabs will make me more distractable. Other potential issues include lag and faster battery drainage.\n\nI'm planning to try out the many-tabs lifestyle on my computer for seven days: from now until Friday, July 21 at 9pm. After that, I make no promises. On my phone, I will simply remain no-extra-tabs.\n\nI just made seven \"desktops\" on my computer (college stuff, puzzlemaking, blog, \"comms panel\", music, personal spreadsheets, misc) and opened some relevant tabs on each of them. I'm not wedded to this particular implementation of the many-tabs lifestyle, so if y'all many-tabs people have any suggestions, I'm happy to take them, as long as it still fits under the umbrella of many-tabs.\n\nI will resolve to the answer that most closely describes my situation after a week.\n\nGeneral policy for my markets: In the rare event of a conflict between my resolution criteria and the agreed-upon common-sense spirit of the market, I may resolve it according to the market's spirit or N\/A, probably after discussion.\n[Market creator] Conflux\n[Creation date] 07-15-2023\n[Closing data] 07-17-2023\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  sorry :(\n---\n[Date]: 07-17-2023\n[Likes] 3\n[Text]: I feel bad about breaking my promise, and delayed the euphoric Command-Q for basically all of today because of this promise.

It tasted bad and made me feel a bit odd, but I was feeling less hungry than before. I also focused on getting more sleep at the same time, which I suspect had a bigger impact. I stopped the potassium after about two weeks and haven't noticed any increase in difficulty or hunger since then.\n---\n[Date]: 12-01-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: My weight this morning was 235.9 lbs. I've kept with 1700 net Calories per day as a target and, if my logs are accurate, I've been slightly under that on average. I attribute the change to getting more sleep, which I think has made it easier to follow through with my intentions. I also tried supplementing potassium for about two weeks and it may have helped but was unpleasant, and I haven't noticed any change in difficulty or results since I stopped. I expect that I will reach my goal if I keep hitting my Calorie target.\n---\n[Date]: 11-07-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Thanks, I've seen the potato posts. I might try a partial version (full-time wouldn't fit well with family meals), or the potassium-supplement experiment, if sticking to calorie limits alone ends up being too much effort. I'll share here if I do that.\n---\n[Date]: 11-07-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]: Thanks. I'm giving my current plan another week or so and will reassess.

I'm not going to limit any other food at all, I'm just going to preferentially consume potatoes when I'm cooking lunch (I normally don't eat breakfast) and keep chips near me during the day.  I will still eat dinner with my family, whatever would normally be on the table with a greater likelihood of adding a side of fries; I will have all the frickin' dairy I want (loads); I'm just going to be doing lots of gnocchi and mashed potatoes and baked potatoes and potato soups and hash browns and gratin and potato curry and stuff.  Maybe learn to make potato bread.  Note when theorizing that I already eat whatever I want, including tons of dairy, so potatoes will displace some of those calories.\n\nResolves YES if I keep this up for at least a couple weeks and lose any marked amount of weight or experience other health benefits I attribute to the potatoes; resolves NO if I keep it up for a couple weeks and no such thing occurs; N\/A if I stop eating potatoes much because I go on a sushi kick or something.\n[Market creator] Alicorn\n[Creation date] 09-09-2022\n[Closing data] 10-08-2022\n------------------------------------------------------\nComments by market creator\n------------------------------------------------------\n[Date]: 09-09-2022\n[Likes] None\n[Text]:  I'd sum up some other ideas as \"something something potassium, lithium, mumblemumble\" and \"something something satiety mumble\".
